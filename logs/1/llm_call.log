Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be state-of-the-art in many cases of supervised learning, but programming an ANN manually can be a challenging task. As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.

With the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.

Using artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.

Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.

The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.

TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.

Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.

TensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.

TensorFlow Advantages
Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.
Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.
Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.
Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).
Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.
Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.
Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.

TensorFlow Disadvantages
Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.
Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.
Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.
GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.
TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
PyTorch Overview

PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.

The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.

PyTorch 2.0

PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.

For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.

Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.

PyTorch Advantages
PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.
Easier to learn.  Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.
Debugging. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).
Dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
Data parallelism. The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores. Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.
Community. PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.
Distributed Training. PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.
PyTorch Disadvantages
Lacks model serving in production. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.
Limited monitoring and visualization interfaces. While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.
Not as extensive as TensorFlow. PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

 

Comparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
1.) Performance Comparison

The following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.

The table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.

2.) Accuracy

The PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.

The validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.

3.) Training Time and Memory Usage

The above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).

While the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.

The memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.

4.) Ease of Use

PyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.

On the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.

Moreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.

 

Differences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary

The answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.

In general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.

PyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.

TensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.

Another major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.

 

Comparison List
Feature	PyTorch	TensorFlow
Ease of Use	More Pythonic syntax and easier to debug	A steeper learning curve requires more boilerplate code
Dynamic Computation Graph	Easier to modify the computation graph during runtime	Static computation graph requires recompilation for changes
GPU Support	Multi-GPU support is easier to set up and use	Multi-GPU support is more complex and requires more setup, there is a TF API
Community Support	Newer community compared to TensorFlow, growing very fast	Large and active community with extensive resources
Ecosystem	Has fewer libraries and tools compared to TensorFlow	Has an extensive library of pre-built models and tools
Debugging	Easier to debug due to Pythonic syntax and dynamic computation graph	Debugging can be more challenging due to the static computation graph
Research	Often used for research due to its flexibility and ease of use	Often used for production applications due to its speed and scalability
Math Library	PyTorch uses TorchScript for tensor manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations	TensorFlow uses its own math library for both tensor manipulation and numerical computations
Keras Integration	PyTorch does not have a native Keras integration	TensorFlow has a native Keras integration which simplifies model building and training

PyTorch and TensorFlow are two popular software frameworks used for building machine learning and deep learning models.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
PyTorch is a relatively young deep learning framework that is more Python-friendly and ideal for research, prototyping and dynamic projects.
TensorFlow is a mature deep learning framework with strong visualization capabilities and several options for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms.

Deep learning seeks to develop human-like computers to solve real-world problems, all by using special brain-like architectures called artificial neural networks. To help develop these architectures, tech giants like Meta and Google have released various frameworks for the Python deep learning environment, making it easier to learn, build and train diversified neural networks.

In this article, we’ll compare two widely used deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow.

 

What Is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that supports Python, C++ and Java. It is commonly used to develop machine learning models for computer vision, natural language processing and other deep learning tasks. PyTorch was created by the team at Meta AI and open sourced on GitHub in 2017. 

PyTorch has gained popularity for its simplicity, ease of use, dynamic computational graph and efficient memory usage, which we’ll discuss in more detail later.

 

What Is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework for Python, C++, Java and JavaScript. It can be used to build machine learning models for a range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing and task automation. TensorFlow was created by developers at Google and released in 2015. 

TensorFlow is widely applied by companies to develop and automate new systems. It draws its reputation from its distributed training support, scalable production and deployment options, and support for various devices like Android.

Difference Between PyTorch vs. TensorFlow

The key difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the way they execute code. Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type tensor. You can imagine a tensor as a multidimensional array shown in the below picture:

 

1. Mechanism: Dynamic vs. Static Graph Definition

TensorFlow is a framework composed of two core building blocks:

A library for defining computational graphs and runtime for executing such graphs on a variety of different hardware.
A computational graph which has many advantages (but more on that in just a moment).

A computational graph is an abstract way of describing computations as a directed graph. A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. It’s a set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

When you run code in TensorFlow, the computation graphs are defined statically. All communication with the outer world is performed via tf.Session object and tf.Placeholder, which are tensors that will be substituted by external data at runtime. For example, consider the following code snippet. 

This is how a computational graph is generated in a static way before the code is run in TensorFlow. The core advantage of having a computational graph is allowing parallelism or dependency driving scheduling which makes training faster and more efficient.

Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch has two core building blocks: 

Imperative and dynamic building of computational graphs.
Autograds: Performs automatic differentiation of the dynamic graphs.

As you can see in the animation below, the graphs change and execute nodes as you go with no special session interfaces or placeholders. Overall, the framework is more tightly integrated with the Python language and feels more native most of the time. Hence, PyTorch is more of a Pythonic framework and TensorFlow feels like a completely new language.

These differ a lot in the software fields based on the framework you use. TensorFlow provides a way of implementing dynamic graphs using a library called TensorFlow Fold, but PyTorch has it inbuilt.

2. Distributed Training

One main feature that distinguishes PyTorch from TensorFlow is data parallelism. PyTorch optimizes performance by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution from Python. In TensorFlow, you’ll have to manually code and fine tune every operation to be run on a specific device to allow distributed training. However, you can replicate everything in TensorFlow from PyTorch but you need to put in more effort. Below is the code snippet explaining how simple it is to implement distributed training for a model in PyTorch.

3. Visualization

When it comes to visualization of the training process, TensorFlow takes the lead. Data visualization helps the developer track the training process and debug in a more convenient way. TensorFlow’s visualization library is called TensorBoard. PyTorch developers use Visdom, however, the features provided by Visdom are very minimalistic and limited, so TensorBoard scores a point in visualizing the training process.

Features of TensorBoard
Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Visualizing the computational graph (ops and layers).
Viewing histograms of weights, biases or other tensors as they change over time.
Displaying images, text and audio data.
Profiling TensorFlow programs.
Visualizing training in TensorBoard.
Features of Visdom 
Handling callbacks.
Plotting graphs and details.
Managing environments.
Visualizing training in Visdom.
4. Production Deployment

When it comes to deploying trained models to production, TensorFlow is the clear winner. We can directly deploy models in TensorFlow using TensorFlow serving which is a framework that uses REST Client API.

In PyTorch, these production deployments became easier to handle than in its latest 1.0 stable version, but it doesn’t provide any framework to deploy models directly on to the web. You’ll have to use either Flask or Django as the backend server. So, TensorFlow serving may be a better option if performance is a concern.

5. Defining a Neural Network in PyTorch and TensorFlow

Let’s compare how we declare the neural network in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In PyTorch, your neural network will be a class and using torch.nn package we import the necessary layers that are needed to build your architecture. All the layers are first declared in the __init__() method, and then in the forward() method we define how input x is traversed to all the layers in the network. Lastly, we declare a variable model and assign it to the defined architecture (model  = NeuralNet()).

Keras, a neural network framework which uses TensorFlow as the backend, is merged into TF Repository, meaning the syntax of declaring layers in TensorFlow is similar to the syntax of Keras. First, we declare the variable and assign it to the type of architecture we will be declaring, in this case a “Sequential()” architecture. Next, we directly add layers in a sequential manner using the model.add() method. The type of layer can be imported from tf.layers as shown in the code snippet below.

 

What Can Be Built With PyTorch vs. TensorFlow?

Initially, neural networks were used to solve simple classification problems like handwritten digit recognition or identifying a car’s registration number using cameras. But thanks to the latest frameworks and NVIDIA’s high computational graphics processing units (GPU’s), we can train neural networks on terabytes of data and solve far more complex problems. A few notable achievements include reaching state of the art performance on the IMAGENET dataset using convolutional neural networks implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The trained model can be used in different applications, such as object detection, image semantic segmentation and more.

Although the architecture of a neural network can be implemented on any of these frameworks, the result will not be the same. The training process has a lot of parameters that are framework dependent. For example, if you are training a dataset on PyTorch you can enhance the training process using GPU’s as they run on CUDA (a C++ backend). In TensorFlow you can access GPU’s but it uses its own inbuilt GPU acceleration, so the time to train these models will always vary based on the framework you choose.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: My Recommendation

TensorFlow is a very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. PyTorch, on the other hand, is still a relatively young framework with stronger community movement and it’s more Python-friendly.

What I would recommend is if you want to make things faster and build AI-related products, TensorFlow is a good choice. PyTorch is mostly recommended for research-oriented developers as it supports fast and dynamic training.

While AI may not take over the world anytime soon—at least as far as we know—it has transformed how we live our lives and conduct business. The machine learning market, once valued at $3.871 billion in 2022, is expected to grow to $49.875 billion by 2032—a 32.8 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR).

These advancements in AI technology would be impossible without machine learning (ML). One of the ML tools that make machine learning possible is PyTorch, a popular machine learning framework.

In this article, we will learn about PyTorch in detail, including how it works, its pros and cons, its applications, and how it compares against other machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for training deep neural networks (DNNs). It was created by the Meta AI research lab in 2016 and released in October of the same year. PyTorch is written in C++ and Python.

The framework has become an alternative to Torch, its predecessor, and grew in popularity because of its ease of use in building ML models and its dynamic computational graphs that allow models to be optimized at runtime. But more on that later.

While it may sound complicated, PyTorch essentially allows you to train machine learning models in a few lines of Python-like code. Just like how a regular toolbox helps carpenters build chairs, tables, etc, PyTorch gives developers the tools to create and fine-tune models for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analysis.

Now that we understand what PyTorch is let’s explore how it works.

How does PyTorch work?

Let’s break down the process of training a neural network with PyTorch.

How PyTorch works

Preparing the data. The foundation of any successful neural network lies in the quality and suitability of the input data. PyTorch provides a range of tools and functions to assist with data preprocessing tasks, ensuring your data is in the optimal format for training your model.

The data preparation process involves steps like normalization, data augmentation, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

Converting the data into tensors. Before we can feed data into our neural network, we need to convert it into a representation  that PyTorch can understand — tensors. Tensors are multidimensional arrays that serve as the fundamental data structures in PyTorch.

The conversion is typically done using the torch.tensor function.

Creating datasets and dataloaders. After converting the data into tensors, the next step is to create datasets and dataloaders.

Datasets store data samples and their corresponding labels, while dataloaders iterate over a dataset during training. With the help of a dataloader, you can, for instance, define the sample batch size, specify whether the data must be shuffled to make the model generalize better, etc.  

Defining the neural network. At the heart of any neural network is its architecture, which defines the structure and flow of information through the network and its layers.

In PyTorch, neural networks are defined as Python classes that inherit from the torch.nn.Module class. The class should include the network's layers in the __init__ method and the forward pass logic in the forward method. The forward method defines how the input data passes through these layers to produce the desired output. This method should contain the layers and activation functions that make up the neural network.

Loss function and optimizer. As we train our network, we need a way to quantify how well it's performing and adjust its weights and biases. This is where the loss function and optimizer come in.

The loss function measures how well the network's predictions match the actual labels of the training data. Common loss functions in PyTorch include torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss for classification tasks and torch.nn.MSELoss for regression tasks.

The optimizer helps minimize the loss by adjusting and updating the network’s internal parameters (weights and biases). Popular PyTorch optimizers include algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (torch.optim.SGD), Adam (torch.optim.Adam), and RMSprop (torch.optim.RMSprop).

Training the model. The training, just like with any other tool, involves feeding the neural network batches of data, allowing it to make predictions, and then using the loss function and a selected optimization algorithm to adjust its internal parameters based on how well it performed. PyTorch will report on the loss results after every 1000 batches.

Evaluating the model. After training the model, it’s important to evaluate its performance on a separate test subset of data. This helps to understand how well the model performs on new, unseen data.

Passing the test data through the trained model and comparing its predictions to the correct answers helps measure how well the neural network has learned and helps calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Components and features of PyTorch

Tensors. Tensors are the fundamental data structures used in PyTorch. They are multidimensional arrays that can be used to store data and act as building blocks of PyTorch’s computational processes,helping developers manipulate a model’s inputs, outputs, and parameters. While tensors help represent complex multidimensional data, you can use them for data of any type and size.

Besides, tensors are the best fit for fast GPU-based computation. PyTorch supports parallel computing with platforms like NVIDIA’s CUDA.

What is a tensor in machine learning?

As we mentioned, tensors in machine learning are normally used to represent complex data as multidimensional arrays, but with PyTorch as well as TensorFlow, you can express any kind of data as a tensor:

Scalars: zero-dimensional arrays that carry a single number. Example: torch.tensor(3.14) creates a 0D tensor (scalar) holding the value 3.14
Vectors: one-dimensional arrays that carry multiple scalars of the same type. Example: torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) creates a 1D tensor (vector) with three elements
Matrices: two-dimensional arrays that carry vectors of the same type. Example: torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) creates a 2D tensor (matrix) with two rows and two columns
Multidimensional arrays: they extend beyond two dimensions. Example: torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]) creates a 3D tensor

Modules. Modules are building blocks for creating neural networks. You can think of them as self-contained units that perform specific tasks. A module can contain other modules, parameters, and functions.

Combining multiple modules allows you to create neural network architectures for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

Common PyTorch modules include:

torch module: PyTorch’s main module that contains all other modules
torch.nn module: provides pre-defined layers, loss functions, and activation functions for constructing neural networks
torch.autograd module: provides automatic differentiation for all operations on tensors
torch.optim module: provides neural network optimization algorithms, like SGD, Adam, and RMSProp. Pairing this with the Autograd module makes training models straightforward
torch.utils module: provides utilities and helper functions for tasks like data loading, model saving and loading, and performance profiling. These utilities streamline the ML development process

PyTorch modules

Parameters. Parameters are tensors that store the learnable weights and biases of a model. We can find parameters under the torch.nn module as torch.nn.Parameter.

Dynamic computational graph. First, let’s understand what computational graphs are. Computational graphs are a visual and mathematical way to represent complex mathematical expressions and operations. In a computational graph, nodes represent mathematical operations or functions, while edges represent the flow of data or inputs between the nodes. In machine learning frameworks, computational graphs describe the operations of a neural network, such as backpropagation during training.  

Example of an augmented computational graph by Preferred Networks. Source: PyTorch Blog. CC BY 3.0. No changes to the image were made.

Now, instead of using a static computational graph where you have to define the graph before running, PyTorch provides dynamic computational graphs that are defined and built on the go. This means that operations and nodes can be added or removed dynamically as the computation progresses, which improves flexibility and allows you to debug, build prototypes, and iterate on new models during the training process.

PyTorch’s dynamic graph nature is particularly useful for models with dynamic flow control, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Datasets and Dataloaders. As we mentioned, datasets and dataloaders are primitives that PyTorch provides for working with large datasets.

The dataset class, available in torch.utils.data.Dataset, class represents a collection of data samples that need to be loaded.

The dataloader class, available in torch.utils.data.Dataloader, handles batching, shuffling, and parallel loading of the datasets. It helps reduce the time it takes to load datasets.

Pros of using PyTorch
Easy to use

PyTorch has a user-friendly syntax that closely resembles Python. This Pythonic nature makes it easier for beginner and experienced Python developers to learn PyTorch and use it to train neural networks.

PyTorch’s Pythonic nature also boosts rapid prototyping and helps developers test and iterate ideas quickly.

Compatible with Python libraries

PyTorch integrates seamlessly with Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas to simplify the process of manipulating, processing, and analyzing data.

Using the tools in Python’s rich ecosystem helps speed up development and decrease the cost of production.

Comprehensive documentation

PyTorch’s robust documentation covers basic and advanced details on how the framework works. The documentation includes installation steps, beginner tutorials on tensors, the various modules available, how to build neural networks, and more. It also provides a search bar for easy navigation and research.

Dynamic computation graphs

PyTorch’s support for dynamic computational graphs provides greater flexibility than other machine learning frameworks since the graphs can be optimized during runtime—the period during which the model is being trained or making predictions.

PyTorch’s dynamic nature also makes it easier to debug and understand how models behave during training since the computational graph gives you real-time feedback on the results of every operation. It also supports Python’s native pdb and ipdb debugging tools, which makes it easier to rectify issues. Developers can also use PyCharm—the Python IDE—for debugging.

Strong community and industry support

PyTorch has a large and active community that helps its users enjoy their shared knowledge and support. This means PyTorch users get access to several resources, tutorials, libraries, pre-trained models, and tools for visualizing and interpreting models.

Data from Stack Overflow’s 2023 developer survey shows that 8.41 percent of developers use TensorFlow, and 7.8 percent use PyTorch.

PyTorch’s community continually develops libraries like GPyTorch, BoTorch, and Allen NLP, which helps extend the PyTorch framework. Developers can also get assistance and answers to questions at the PyTrch forum or GitHub repository.

Strong support for GPU acceleration

PyTorch can leverage the parallel computing power of GPUs to accelerate the computationally intensive operations involved in training and running deep learning models.

It provides a torch.cuda module that supports integration with tools like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), NVIDIA’s parallel computing platform and API for GPUs.

This parallel processing ability, which allows you to train deep learning models faster, is especially useful for large-scale deep learning projects that require processing large amounts of data.

Good for research

PyTorch’s dynamic computational graph, Pythonic nature, and ease of use for prototyping models have made it a top choice in the research community.

Many large companies like Amazon, Tesla, Meta, and Open AI use PyTorch to power their machine learning and AI research initiatives. For example, switching to PyTorch helped Open AI decrease their iteration time on research ideas in modeling generative AI from weeks to days.

Between 2020 and 2024, 57 percent of research teams used PyTorch for their machine-learning research.

What PyTorch allows us to do is experiment very quickly. It's showing incredible promise. What we are seeing, using these new modeling techniques, we are able to take some of the problems and experiment and deploy them into production in a very short time.

Cons of using PyTorch
Lacks a visual interface

A major disadvantage of PyTorch is its lack of a built-in visual interface. Visualization tools are essential for monitoring and debugging neural networks, providing insights into the training process.

The lack of a visual interface means developers must use command-line tools, custom scripts, and third-party libraries to visualize their model's performance and training progress. This can increase the complexity for users, especially those new to the library or machine learning in general.

Harder to deploy models to mobile devices

The demand for deploying machine learning models on mobile devices has increased, and PyTorch has provided PyTorch Mobile, a runtime that enables developers to run PyTorch models on Android and iOS platforms.

However, PyTorch mobile is not as easy and comprehensive as TensorFlow Lite. It is still in beta, and it requires more manual implementation and configuration than TensorFlow Lite. This can be a barrier for developers looking for a seamless solution to deploy models to mobile applications.

Use cases and applications of PyTorch

PyTorch is widely used across various industries. Here are some common use cases and applications of PyTorch:

Computer vision: Computer vision enables computers to interpret and understand visual information. it helps computers analyze and extract data from images and videos.

PyTorch’s flexible and dynamic nature allows researchers to develop complex architectures like attention mechanisms and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This makes it a top choice for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models for computer-vision-related tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation (GANs).

Natural language processing (NLP): NLP deals with a computer’s ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language. PyTorch’s ability to process and model text data is a top choice for NLP tasks like text classification, language translation, and sentiment analysis.

NLP is widely used to power AI chatbots, personal assistants, and translation software like Google Translate.

Speech and audio processing: This involves using algorithms to analyze, understand, manipulate, and generate speech and audio data.

PyTorch is used in this domain because of its flexibility, efficient tensor operations, and the libraries it offers, like Torchaudio, for processing speech and audio data.

Key speech and audio processing tasks that can be powered by PTorch include speech recognition, speech synthesis, audio classification, and music generation.

Generative models: Generative AI models have taken the world by storm, with GANs and transformer-based models being two of the most widely used ones.

These models are responsible for tasks like image and text generation, style transfer, and data augmentation, and are responsible for the “magic” we see on AI image generation platforms like Midjourney and AI chatbots like ChatGPT.

Companies using PyTorch

PyTorch is being used to identify cancer cells, discover new drugs, build video games, make self-driving cars, and more. It is powering AI and ML research at academic institutions and Fortune 500 companies alike. Here are some businesses using PyTorch.

Genentech

Genentech uses PyTorch to develop new drugs by searching through millions of chemical structures, building models that predict how patients will react to treatments, and developing vaccines for different types of cancer.

Genentech also works with the PyTorch community and contributes to its development.

Uber

Uber uses PyTorch to build Pyro, a deep probabilistic programming language. They also use it to deploy hundreds of PyTorch models for applications like estimated time of arrival (ETA) predictions, demand forecasting, and menu transcriptions for Uber Eats.

Amazon

Amazon uses PyTorch to flag ads that don’t comply with the content guidelines of its advertising service. They use PyTorch to develop computer vision and natural language processing models that automatically flag potentially non-compliant ads.

Integrating PyTorch with their internal infrastructure allows Amazon to provide an optimal customer experience and create ML models that are fast enough to serve ads in milliseconds.

Meta

Meta uses PyTorch to train its language translation system that handles 6 billion translations a day and to power its Instagram’s recommendation system that suggests new content (Feeds, Stories, or Reels) that match your taste.

Tesla

Tesla uses PyTorch to train and deploy deep learning models for Autopilot—their self-driving technology—and to power features like lane-keeping assistance, object detection, and Smart Summon for their cars.

How Computer Vision Applications Work

Airbnb

Airbnb uses PyTorch for their customer service department’s dialog assistant. The assistant is powered by a sequence-to-sequence model (built with PyTorch) that delivers smart replies to customers and helps improve customer interactions.

Comparing PyTorch with other machine learning libraries

While PyTorch is a top choice in the AI and machine learning domain, it's not the only option, as alternatives like TensorFlow and Keras exist. Let’s explore how PyTorch compares to its alternatives.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a low-level open-source library for implementing machine learning models, training deep neural networks, and solving complex numerical problems. It was created by Google Brain Team and released in 2015.

Types of computational graphs. PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs, while TensorFlow (versions lower than 2.0) uses static computational graphs.

PyTorch’s dynamic computational graph provides greater flexibility and ease of experimentation during model development. It allows developers to modify the graph on the go. On the other hand, TensorFlow’s static computational graphs offer better optimization opportunities for production-ready models.

Deployment. TensorFlow is the winner when it comes to deploying trained models to production. It offers TensorFlow Serving, an in-built model deployment tool that Google uses for its projects. Torchserve is available for deploying PyTorch models. Torchserve doesn’t offer as many features as TensorFlow. However, its latest version supports HuggingFace, AWS Cloud Formation, Nvidia Waveglow, and others.

Learning curve. PyTorch is easier to learn and takes a “Pythonic” approach. This means that it sticks closely to Python and uses core Python concepts like classes, structures, and conditional loops. TensorFlow, on the other hand, has a more complex syntax than PyTorch, which can make it difficult for beginners to understand.

Research friendliness: While both frameworks are used extensively in research, the flexibility offered by PyTorch, combined with its Pythonic nature, makes it a favorite for many researchers. They can easily tweak models, try new architectures, and experiment without much boilerplate.

Popularity. As the older library, TensorFlow has a larger community and more learning resources like tutorials, courses, and books. As of this writing, it also has more GitHub stars (183 thousand) than PyTorch (79.1 thousand).

PyTorch vs Keras

Technically speaking, Keras is not a library. It is actually a high-level deep learning API for developing neural networks. It was developed by Google in 2015, is written in Python, and can run on top of Microsoft CNTK, TensorFlow, and Theano.

Level of abstraction. PyTorch provides a low-level and flexible approach, allowing developers to have more control over the model architecture and training process. Keras, on the other hand, prioritizes simplicity and abstraction. It provides a user-friendly interface that abstracts away many of the low-level details, making it easier to prototype and build models quickly. This high-level abstraction makes Keras more accessible to beginners and researchers who may not have extensive experience with low-level tensor operations.

Computation graphs. Similar to TensorFlow, Keras has a static computational graph. When using the functional API or the Sequential model in Keras, the computational graph is defined before execution, and any modifications require redefining the graph.

While Keras takes the static approach by default, it also supports eager execution, which allows for dynamic computation graphs similar to PyTorch.

Popularity. PyTorch’s dynamic computation graphs, low-level control, and tight integration with Python make it the preferred solution for academic research and industry applications.

Keras’s high-level abstraction and ease of use have made it a popular choice for rapid prototyping and experimentation and for those new to deep learning. It currently has 61.1 thousand GitHub stars.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow in 2023

Should you use PyTorch vs TensorFlow in 2023? This guide walks through the major pros and cons of PyTorch vs TensorFlow, and how you can pick the right framework.

Ryan O'Connor

Senior Developer Educator

Dec 14, 2021

PyTorch and TensorFlow are far and away the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. The debate over which framework is superior is a longstanding point of contentious debate, with each camp having its share of fervent supporters.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed so quickly over their relatively short lifetimes that the debate landscape is ever-evolving. Outdated or incomplete information is abundant, and further obfuscates the complex discussion of which framework has the upper hand in a given domain.

While TensorFlow has a reputation for being an industry-focused framework and PyTorch has a reputation for being a research-focused framework, we’ll see that these notions stem partially from outdated information. The conversation about which framework reigns supreme is much more nuanced going into 2023 - let’s explore these differences now.

#
Practical Considerations

PyTorch and TensorFlow alike have unique development stories and complicated design-decision histories. Previously, this has made comparing the two a complicated technical discussion about their current features and speculated future features. Given that both frameworks have matured exponentially since their inceptions, many of these technical differences are vestigial at this point.

Luckily for those of us who don’t want their eyes glazing over, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate currently comes down to three practical considerations:

Model Availability: With the domain of Deep Learning expanding every year and models becoming bigger in turn, training State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models from scratch is simply not feasible anymore. There are fortunately many SOTA models publicly available, and it is important to utilize them where possible.
Deployment Infrastructure: Training well-performing models is pointless if they can’t be put to use. Lowering time-to-deploy is paramount, especially with the growing popularity of microservice business models; and efficient deployment has the potential to make-or-break many businesses that center on Machine Learning.
Ecosystems: No longer is Deep Learning relegated to specific use cases in highly controlled environments. AI is injecting new power into a litany of industries, so a framework that sits within a larger ecosystem which facilitates development for mobile, local, and server applications is important. Also, the advent of specialized Machine Learning hardware, such as Google’s Edge TPU, means that successful practitioners need to work with a framework that can integrate well with this hardware.

We’ll explore each of these three practical considerations in turn, and then provide our recommendations for which framework to use in different areas.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Model Availability

Implementing a successful Deep Learning model from scratch can be a very tricky task, especially for applications such as NLP where engineering and optimization are difficult. The growing complexity of SOTA models makes training and tuning simply impractical, approaching impossible, tasks for small-scale enterprises. Startups and researchers alike simply do not have the computational resources to utilize and explore such models on their own, so access to pre-trained models for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or out-of-the-box inference is invaluable.

In the arena of model availability, PyTorch and TensorFlow diverge sharply. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own official model repositories, as we’ll explore below in the Ecosystems section, but practitioners may want to utilize models from other sources. Let’s take a quantitative look at model availability for each framework.

HuggingFace

HuggingFace makes it possible to incorporate trained and tuned SOTA models into your pipelines in just a few lines of code.

When we compare HuggingFace model availability for PyTorch vs TensorFlow, the results are staggering. Below we see a chart of the total number of models available on HuggingFace that are either PyTorch or TensorFlow exclusive, or available for both frameworks. As we can see, the number of models available for use exclusively in PyTorch absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Almost 92% of models are PyTorch exclusive, up from 85% last year. In contrast, only about 8% being TensorFlow exclusive, with only about 14% of all models available for TensorFlow (down from 16% last year). Further, over 45 thousand PyTorch exclusive models were added in 2022, whereas only about 4 thousand TensorFlow exclusive models were added.

We see interesting results if we relegate our purview to only the 30 most popular models on HuggingFace. While all models are available in PyTorch and none are TensorFlow exclusive, like last year, the number of models available for both has increased from 19 to 23, indicating that there may be an effort for TensorFlow coverage on the most popular models.

Research Papers

For research practitioners especially, having access to models from recently-published papers is critical. Attempting to recreate new models that you want to explore in a different framework wastes valuable time, so being able to clone a repository and immediately start experimenting means that you can focus on the important work.

Given that PyTorch is the de facto research framework, we would expect the trend we observed on HuggingFace to continue into the research community as a whole; and our intuition is correct.

We’ve aggregated data from eight top research journals over the past several years into the below graph, which shows the relative proportion of publications that use PyTorch or TensorFlow. As you can see, the adoption of PyTorch was extremely rapid and, in just a few years, grew from use in just about 7% to use in almost 80% of papers that use either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Data source

Much of the reason for this rapid adoption was due to difficulties with TensorFlow 1 that were exacerbated in the context of research, leading researchers to look to the newer alternative PyTorch. While many of TensorFlow’s issues were addressed with the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, PyTorch’s momentum has been great enough for it to maintain itself as the established research-centric framework, at least from a community perspective.

We can see the same pattern if we look at the fraction of researchers who migrated frameworks. When we look at publications by authors that were using either PyTorch or TensorFlow in 2018 and 2019, we find that the majority of authors who used TensorFlow in 2018 migrated to PyTorch in 2019 (55%), while the vast majority of authors who used PyTorch in 2018 stayed with PyTorch 2019 (85%). This data is visualized in the Sankey diagram below, where the left side corresponds to 2018 and the right side to 2019. Note that the data represent proportions of users of each framework in 2018, not total numbers.

Data source

Careful readers will notice that this data is from before the release of TensorFlow 2, but as we will see in the next section, this fact is irrelevant in the research community.

Papers with Code

Lastly, we look at data from Papers with Code - a website whose mission it is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, datasets, etc. We’ve plotted the percentage of papers which utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, or another framework over time, with data aggregated quarterly, from late 2017 to the current quarter. We see the steady growth of papers utilizing PyTorch - out of the 3,319 repositories created this quarter, nearly 70% of them are implemented in PyTorch, with just 4% implemented in TensorFlow (down from 11% last year).

Conversely, we see the steady decline in use of TensorFlow. Even the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, which addressed many of the issues that made using TensorFlow 1 painful for research, was not enough to reverse this trend. We see a near-monotonic decline in the popularity of TensorFlow, even after the release of TensorFlow 2.

Model Availability - Final Words

It is obvious from the above data that PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape. While TensorFlow 2 made utilizing TensorFlow for research a lot easier, PyTorch has given researchers no reason to go back and give TensorFlow another try. Furthermore, backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2 only exacerbate this issue.

For now, PyTorch is the clear winner in the area of research simply for the reason that it has been widely adopted by the community, and most publications/available models use PyTorch.

There are a couple of notable exceptions / notes:

Google Brain: Google Brain makes heavy use of JAX and makes use of Flax - Google's neural network library for JAX.
DeepMind: DeepMind standardized the use of TensorFlow in 2016, although they announced in 2020 that they were using JAX to accelerate their research. In this announcement they also give an overview of their JAX ecosystem, most notably Haiku, their JAX-based neural network library.

DeepMind created Sonnet, which is a high-level API for TensorFlow that is tailored towards research and sometimes called “the research version of Keras”, that may be useful to those considering using TensorFlow for research. Note that its development has slowed down. Further, DeepMind’s Acme framework may be essential to Reinforcement Learning practitioners.

OpenAI: On the other hand, OpenAI standardized the usage of PyTorch internally in 2020; but, once again for those in Reinforcement Learning, their older baselines repository is implemented in TensorFlow. Baselines provides high-quality implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, so TensorFlow may be the best choice for Reinforcement Learning practitioners.
JAX: Google has another project called JAX that is growing in popularity in the research community. There is, in some sense, a lot less overhead in JAX compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow; but it’s underlying philosophy is different than both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and for this reason migrating to JAX may not be a good option for most. There are a growing number of models/papers that utilize JAX, and it is being developed at a very rapid pace. While last year the future of JAX was less clear, it is now apparent that JAX is here to stay.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Deployment

While employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for cutting-edge results is the holy grail of Deep Learning applications from an inference perspective, this ideal is not always practical or even possible to achieve in an industry setting. Access to SOTA models is pointless if there is a laborious, error-prone process of making their intelligence actionable. Therefore, beyond considering which framework affords you access to the shiniest models, it is important to consider the end-to-end Deep Learning process in each framework.

TensorFlow has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications since its inception, and for good reason. TensorFlow has a litany of associated tools that make the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.

PyTorch used to be extremely lackluster from a deployment perspective, but it has worked on closing this gap in recent years. The introduction of TorchServe last year and PyTorch Live just a couple of weeks ago has afforded much-needed native deployment tools, but has PyTorch closed the deployment gap enough to make its use worthwhile in an industry setting? Let’s take a look.

TensorFlow

TensorFlow offers scalable production with static graphs which are optimized for inference performance. When deploying a model with TensorFlow, you use either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite depending on the application.

TensorFlow Serving

TensorFlow Serving is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on servers, be them in-house or on the cloud, and is used within the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) end-to-end Machine Learning platform. Serving makes it easy to serialize models into well-defined directories with model tags, and select which model is used to make inference requests while keeping server architecture and APIs static.

Serving allows you to easily deploy models on specialized gRPC servers, which run Google’s open-source framework for high-performance RPC. gRPC was designed with the intent on connecting a diverse ecosystem of microservices, so these servers are well suited for model deployment. Serving as a whole is tightly integrated with Google Cloud via Vertex AI and integrates with Kubernetes and Docker.

TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on mobile or IoT/embedded devices. TFLite compresses and optimizes models for these devices, and more widely addresses 5 constraints for on-device Artificial Intelligence - latency, connectivity, privacy, size, and power consumption. The same pipeline is used to simultaneously export both standard Keras-based SavedModels (used with Serving) and TFLite models, so model quality can be compared.

TFLite can be used for both Android and iOS, as well as microcontrollers (ARM with Bazel or CMake) and embedded Linux (e.g. a Coral device). TensorFlow's APIs for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Swift (archived as of this year), give developers a wide array of language options.

PyTorch

PyTorch has invested in making deployment easier, previously being notoriously lackluster in this arena. Previously, PyTorch users would need to use something like Flask or Django to build a REST API on top of the model, but now they have native deployment options in the form of TorchServe and PyTorch Live.

TorchServe

TorchServe is an open-source deployment framework resulting from a collaboration between AWS and Facebook (now Meta) and was released in 2020. It has features like endpoint specification, model archiving, and observing metrics; but is still older than the TensorFlow alternative. Both REST and gRPC APIs are supported with TorchServe.

PyTorch Live

PyTorch first released PyTorch Mobile in 2019, which was designed to create an end-to-end workflow for the deployment of optimized machine learning models for Android, iOS, and Linux.

PyTorch Live was released in late 2022 to build upon Mobile. It uses JavaScript and React Native to create cross-platform iOS and Android AI-powered apps with associated UIs. The on-device inference is still performed by PyTorch Mobile. Live comes with example projects to bootstrap from, and has plans to support audio and video input in the future

Deployment - Final Words

Currently, TensorFlow still wins on the deployment front. Serving and TFLite are more robust than the PyTorch competitors, and the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices is a must-have for many industries. In contrast, PyTorch Live focuses on mobile only, and TorchServe is still in its infancy. The playing field is more even for applications where models run in the cloud instead of on edge devices. It will be interesting to see how the deployment arena changes in the coming years, but for now Round 2 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to TensorFlow.

A final note on the issues of model availability and deployment: For those who want to use the TensorFlow deployment infrastructure but want access to models that are only available in PyTorch, consider using ONNX to port the models from PyTorch to TensorFlow

#
PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Ecosystems

The final important consideration that separates PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2023 is the ecosystems in which they are situated. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are capable frameworks from a modeling perspective, and their technical differences at this point are less important than the ecosystems surrounding them, which provide tools for easy deployment, management, distributed training, etc. Let’s take a look at each framework’s ecosystem now.

PyTorch
Hub

Beyond platforms like HuggingFace, there is also the official PyTorch Hub - a research-oriented platform for sharing repositories with pre-trained models. Hub has a wide range of models, including those for Audio, Vision, and NLP. It also has generative models, including a GAN for generating high-quality images of celebrity faces.

Image source
PyTorch-XLA

If you want train PyTorch models on Google's Cloud TPUs, then PyTorch-XLA is the tool for you. PyTorch-XLA is a Python package that connects the two with the XLA compiler. You can check out PyTorch-XLA's GitHub repo here.

TorchVision

TorchVision is PyTorch's official Computer Vision library. It includes everything you need for your Computer Vision projects, including model architectures and popular datasets. For more vision models, you can check out TIMM (pyTorch IMage Models). You can check out the TorchVision GitHub repo here.

TorchText

If your area of expertise is Natural Language Processing rather than Computer Vision, then you might want to check out TorchText. It contains datasets frequently seen in the NLP domain, as well as data processing utilities to operate on these and other datasets. You might want to check out fairseq too, so you can perform tasks like translation and summarization on your text. You can check out the TorchText GitHub repo here.

TorchAudio

Perhaps before you can process text, you need to extract it from an audio file with ASR. In this case, check out TorchAudio - PyTorch's official audio library. TorchAudio includes popular audio models like DeepSpeech and Wav2Vec, and provides walkthroughs and pipelines for ASR and other tasks. You can check TorchAudio's GitHub repo here.

SpeechBrain

If TorchAudio isn't quite what you're looking for, then you might want to check out SpeechBrain - an open-source speech toolkit for PyTorch. SpeechBrain supports ASR, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, and more! If you don’t want to build any models and instead want a plug-and-play tool with features like Auto Chapters, Sentiment Analysis, Entity Detection, and more, check out AssemblyAI’s own Speech-to-Text API.

ESPnet

ESPnet is a toolkit for end-to-end speech processing which uses PyTorch in conjunction with Kaldi's style of data processing. With ESPnet, you can implement end-to-end speech recognition, translation, diarization, and more!

AllenNLP

If you're looking for even more NLP tools, you might want to check out AllenNLP, an open-source NLP research library built on PyTorch and backed by the Allen Institute for AI.

Ecosystem Tools

Check out PyTorch’s Tools page for other libraries that may be useful, such as those tailored to Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. This includes fast.ai - a popular library for producing neural networks using modern best practices.

TorchElastic

TorchElastic was released in 2020 and is the result of collaboration between AWS and Facebook. It is a tool for distributed training which manages worker processes and coordinates restart behaviors so that you can train models on a cluster of compute nodes which can change dynamically without affecting training. Therefore, TorchElastic prevents catastrophic failures from issues such as server maintenance events or network issues so you do not lose training progress. TorchElastic features integration with Kubernetes and has been incorporated into PyTorch 1.9+.

TorchX

TorchX is an SDK for the quick building and deployment of Machine Learning applications. TorchX includes the Training Session Manager API to launch distributed PyTorch applications onto supported schedulers. It is responsible for launching the distributed job while natively supporting jobs that are locally managed by TorchElastic.

Lightning

PyTorch Lightning is sometimes called the Keras of PyTorch. While this comparison is slightly misleading, Lightning is a useful tool for simplifying the model engineering and training processes in PyTorch, and it has matured significantly since its initial release in 2019. Lightning approaches the modeling process in an object-oriented way, defining reusable and shareable components that can be utilized across projects. For more information on Lightning and a comparison of how its workflow compares to vanilla PyTorch, you can check out this tutorial.

TensorFlow
Hub

TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained Machine Learning models ready for fine-tuning, allowing you to use a model like BERT with just a few lines of code. Hub contains TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js models for different use cases, with models available for image, video, audio, and text problem domains. Get started with a tutorial here, or see a list of models here.

Model Garden

If ready-to-use pre-trained models aren’t going to work for your application, then TensorFlow’s Model Garden is a repository that makes the source code for SOTA models available. It is useful if you want to go under-the-hood to understand how models work, or modify them for your own needs - something that is not possible with serialized pre-trained models beyond transfer learning and fine tuning.

Model Garden contains directories for official models maintained by Google, research models maintained by researchers, and curated community models maintained by the community. TensorFlow’s long term goal is to provide pre-trained versions of models from Model Garden on Hub, and for pretrained models on Hub to have available source code in Model Garden.

Extended (TFX)

TensorFlow Extended is TensorFlow's end-to-end platform for model deployment. You can load, validate, analyze, and transform data; train and evaluate models; deploy models using Serving or Lite; and then track artifacts and their dependencies. TFX can be used with Jupyter or Colab, and can use Apache Airflow/Beam or Kubernetes for orchestration. TFX is tightly integrated with Google Cloud and can be used with Vertex AI Pipelines.

Vertex AI

Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s unified Machine Learning platform. It was released this year and seeks to unify services on GCP, AI Platform, and AutoML into one platform. Vertex AI can help you automate, monitor, and govern Machine Learning systems by orchestrating workflows in a serverless manner. Vertex AI can also store artifacts of a workflow, allowing you to keep track of dependencies and a model’s training data, hyperparameters, and source code.

MediaPipe

MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal, cross-platform applied Machine Learning pipelines which can be used for face detection, multi-hand tracking, object detection, and more. The project is open-source and has bindings in several languages including Python, C++, and JavaScript. More information on getting started with MediaPipe and its ready-to-use solutions can be found here.

Coral

While there are a variety of SaaS companies that rely on cloud-based AI, there is a growing need for local AI in many industries. Google Coral was created to address this need, and is a complete toolkit to build products with local AI. Coral was released in 2020 and addresses the difficulties of implementing on-board AI mentioned in the TFLite portion of the Deployment section, including privacy and efficiency.

Coral offers an array of hardware products for prototyping, production, and sensing, some of which are essentially more powerful Raspberry Pis created specifically for AI applications. Their products utilize their Edge TPUs for high performance inference on low-power devices. Coral also offers pre-compiled models for image segmentation, pose estimation, speech recognition, and more to provide scaffolding for developers looking to create their own local AI systems. The essential steps to create a model can be seen in the flowchart below.

Image source
TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for Machine Learning that allows you to train and deploy models both in the browser and server-side with Node.js. They provide documentation with examples and information on how to import Python models, pre-trained models ready for out-of-the-box use, and live demos with associated code.

Cloud

TensorFlow Cloud is a library that allows you to connect your local environment to Google Cloud. The provided APIs are designed to bridge the gap from model building and debugging on your local machine to distributed training and hyperparameter tuning on Google Cloud, without the need to use Cloud Console.

Colab

Google Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment, very similar to Jupyter. It is easy to connect Colab to Google Cloud for GPU or TPU training. Note that PyTorch can also be used with Colab.

Playground

Playground is a small but polished educational tool for understanding the basics of neural networks. It offers a simple dense network visualized inside a clean UI. You can change the number of layers in the network and their sizes to see in real time how features are learned. You can also see how changing hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization strength affects the learning process on different datasets. Playground allows you to play the learning process in real time to see in a highly visual way how inputs are transformed during the training process. Playground even comes with an open-source small neural network library on which it was built so you can understand the nuts and bolts of the network.

Datasets

Google Research’s Datasets is a dataset resource on which Google periodically releases datasets. Google also has a Dataset Search for access to an even wider dataset database. PyTorch users can of course take advantage of these datasets as well.

Ecosystems - Final Words

This round is easily the closest of the three. Google has invested heavily in ensuring that there is an available product in each relevant area of an end-to-end Deep Learning workflow, although how well-polished these products are varies across this landscape. Even still, the close integration with Google Cloud along with TFX make the end-to-end development process efficient and organized, and the ease of porting models to Google Coral devices hands a landslide victory to TensorFlow for some industries. That having been said, it is clear TensorFlow is a fading framework, and the rapid development of ONNX only exacerbates this process given that the TensorFlow ecosystem can be leveraged by teams who build with PyTorch for many applications. For this reason, unlike last year, PyTorch will win this battle.

Round 3 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.

#
PyTorch 2.0 and JAX
PyTorch 2.0

At the end of 2022, PyTorch 2.0 was announced, and it marks a very substantial shift in the story of Deep Learning frameworks. Just as PyTorch had the benefit of learning from TensorFlow's mistakes, PyTorch 2 has the benefit of learning from PyTorch 1's "mistakes". These "mistakes" are really design decisions that made sense in 2016, but less so in 2023. Deep Learning is much more mature than it was when PyTorch 1 was created - just in the last year we've seen substantial progress in models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT.

The flagship feature of PyTorch 2.0 (if you had to pick) is model compilation, which will allow models to be ahead-of-time compiled for lightning-fast execution. PyTorch 2.0 has made efforts to make distributed training simpler too, which means that the lifecycle for PyTorch Deep Learning projects may be reduced.

PyTorch 2.0's first stable release is slated for early March of 2023

JAX

Google's JAX has quickly been growing in popularity. While not a Deep Learning framework itself, it is a numerical computing library with autograd and easy distributed training. Combined with the fact that it is built on XLA, JAX is clearly a very strong candidate for the future of Deep Learning.

The big caveat is that much of its power stems from the fact that JAX takes a functionally-pure approach that may be foreign to PyTorch and TensorFlow practitioners. That having been said, the Deep Learning infrastructure surrounding JAX matures every month; and if the functionally-pure approach does not prove to make JAX a nonstarter, we expect a rapid adoption in the coming years.

At this point, it is apparent that the battle for the future of Deep Learning will be PyTorch 2.0 vs JAX, and only time will tell who the victor is.

Should I Use PyTorch or TensorFlow?

As you probably expect, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate does not have a single correct answer - it is only sensible to say that one framework is superior to another with respect to a specific use-case. To help you decide which framework is best for you, we’ve compiled our recommendations into flow charts below, with each chart tailored to a different area of interest.

What if I’m in Industry?

If you perform Deep Learning engineering in an industry setting, you’re likely using TensorFlow. In this case, you should probably stick with it. TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end TensorFlow Extended platform are invaluable for those who need to productionize models. Easy deployment on a gRPC server along with model monitoring and artifact tracking are critical tools for industry use. You may want to start thinking about migrating to PyTorch in the future, but for now you can stick with your current workflow.

On the other hand, if you're starting a project from scratch, it may be advisable to build with PyTorch and then deploy with TensorFlow's tools. If you want to use one ecosystem and don't want to deal with the hassle of ONNX, then TensorFlow remains a good option.

Bottom line: if you have to choose one framework, choose TensorFlow.

What if I’m a Researcher?

If you’re a researcher, you’re likely using PyTorch and should probably stick with it for now. PyTorch is the de facto research framework, and the announcement of PyTorch 2.0 only makes its future more promising. We certainly encourage you to check out JAX (especially if you train on TPUs) and think about being an early adopter, but most researchers will probably want to stick with PyTorch this year.

There are a couple of notable exceptions to this rule, the most notable being that those in Reinforcement Learning should consider using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has a native Agents library for Reinforcement Learning, and DeepMind’s Acme framework is implemented in TensorFlow. OpenAI’s Baselines model repository is also implemented in TensorFlow, although OpenAI’s Gym can be used with either TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you plan to use TensorFlow for your research, you should also check out DeepMind’s Sonnet for higher-level abstractions. That having been said, Reinforcement Learning is finding its way into more and more Deep Learning research, so a stronger PyTorch ecosystem is likely to develop around it in the coming years.

Whichever framework you choose, you should keep your eye on JAX in 2023, especially as its community grows and more publications begin utilizing it.

Bottom line: if you need to choose one framework, choose PyTorch

What if I’m a Professor?

If you’re a professor, which framework to use for a Deep Learning course depends on the goals of the course. If the focus of your course is to produce industry-ready Deep Learning engineers who can hit the ground running with competency in the entire end-to-end Deep Learning process, not just Deep Learning theory, then you should use TensorFlow. In this case, exposure to the TensorFlow ecosystem and its tools along with end-to-end practice projects will be very instructive and valuable.

If the focus of your course is on Deep Learning theory and understanding the under-the-hood of Deep Learning models, then you should use PyTorch. This is especially true if you are teaching a high-level undergraduate course or an early graduate-level course which intends to prepare students to perform Deep Learning research.

Ideally, students should get exposure to each framework, and dedicating some time to understanding the differences between the frameworks is probably valuable despite the time constraints of a single semester. If the course is part of a larger program in Machine Learning with many classes dedicated to different topics, it may be better to stick with the framework best suited for the course material rather than try to give exposure to both.

What if I’m a Hobbyist?

If you’re a hobbyist who’s interested in Deep Learning, which framework you use will depend on your goals. If you’re implementing a Deep Learning model as part of some larger project, then TensorFlow is likely what you want to use, especially if you are deploying to an IoT/embedded device. While you could use PyTorch for mobile applications given the release of PyTorch Live, TensorFlow + TFLite is still the preferred methodology for now.

If your goal is to learn about Deep Learning for its own sake, then which framework is best in this case depends on your background. In general, PyTorch is probably the better option here, especially if you’re used to working in Python. If you’re a total beginner who’s just getting started learning about Deep Learning, see the next section.

What if I’m a Total Beginner?

If you’re a total beginner who’s interested in Deep Learning and just wants to get started, we recommend using Keras. Using its high-level components, you can easily get started understanding the basics of Deep Learning. Once you are prepared to start understanding more thoroughly the nuts-and-bolts of Deep Learning, you have a couple of options:

If you do not want to install a new framework and are worried about how well your competency will translate to a new API, then you can try “dropping down” from Keras to TensorFlow. Depending on your background, TensorFlow may be confusing, in which case try moving to PyTorch.

If you want a framework that more natively feels like Python, then moving to PyTorch may be your best move. In this case, be aware that you’ll have to install a new framework and potentially rewrite custom scripts. Further, if PyTorch seems a bit cumbersome to you, you can compartmentalize your code and get rid of some boilerplate by using PyTorch Lightning.

If you’re a complete beginner, consider watching some YouTube tutorials in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to decide which framework feels more intuitive to you.

#
Final Words

As you can see, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate is a nuanced one whose landscape is constantly changing, and out-of-date information makes understanding this landscape even more difficult. In 2023, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are very mature frameworks, and their core Deep Learning features overlap significantly. Today, the practical considerations of each framework, like their model availability, time to deploy, and associated ecosystems, supersede their technical differences.

You’re not making a mistake in choosing either framework, for both have good documentation, many learning resources, and active communities.  While PyTorch has become the de facto research framework after its explosive adoption by the research community and TensorFlow remains the legacy industry framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.

Hopefully our recommendations have helped you navigate the complicated PyTorch vs TensorFlow landscape! For more helpful information, check out other content on our blog!

PyTorch and TensorFlow are two popular software frameworks used for building machine learning and deep learning models.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
PyTorch is a relatively young deep learning framework that is more Python-friendly and ideal for research, prototyping and dynamic projects.
TensorFlow is a mature deep learning framework with strong visualization capabilities and several options for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms.

Deep learning seeks to develop human-like computers to solve real-world problems, all by using special brain-like architectures called artificial neural networks. To help develop these architectures, tech giants like Meta and Google have released various frameworks for the Python deep learning environment, making it easier to learn, build and train diversified neural networks.

In this article, we’ll compare two widely used deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow.

 

What Is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that supports Python, C++ and Java. It is commonly used to develop machine learning models for computer vision, natural language processing and other deep learning tasks. PyTorch was created by the team at Meta AI and open sourced on GitHub in 2017. 

PyTorch has gained popularity for its simplicity, ease of use, dynamic computational graph and efficient memory usage, which we’ll discuss in more detail later.

 

What Is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework for Python, C++, Java and JavaScript. It can be used to build machine learning models for a range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing and task automation. TensorFlow was created by developers at Google and released in 2015. 

TensorFlow is widely applied by companies to develop and automate new systems. It draws its reputation from its distributed training support, scalable production and deployment options, and support for various devices like Android.

Difference Between PyTorch vs. TensorFlow

The key difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the way they execute code. Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type tensor. You can imagine a tensor as a multidimensional array shown in the below picture:

 

1. Mechanism: Dynamic vs. Static Graph Definition

TensorFlow is a framework composed of two core building blocks:

A library for defining computational graphs and runtime for executing such graphs on a variety of different hardware.
A computational graph which has many advantages (but more on that in just a moment).

A computational graph is an abstract way of describing computations as a directed graph. A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. It’s a set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

When you run code in TensorFlow, the computation graphs are defined statically. All communication with the outer world is performed via tf.Session object and tf.Placeholder, which are tensors that will be substituted by external data at runtime. For example, consider the following code snippet. 

This is how a computational graph is generated in a static way before the code is run in TensorFlow. The core advantage of having a computational graph is allowing parallelism or dependency driving scheduling which makes training faster and more efficient.

Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch has two core building blocks: 

Imperative and dynamic building of computational graphs.
Autograds: Performs automatic differentiation of the dynamic graphs.

As you can see in the animation below, the graphs change and execute nodes as you go with no special session interfaces or placeholders. Overall, the framework is more tightly integrated with the Python language and feels more native most of the time. Hence, PyTorch is more of a Pythonic framework and TensorFlow feels like a completely new language.

These differ a lot in the software fields based on the framework you use. TensorFlow provides a way of implementing dynamic graphs using a library called TensorFlow Fold, but PyTorch has it inbuilt.

2. Distributed Training

One main feature that distinguishes PyTorch from TensorFlow is data parallelism. PyTorch optimizes performance by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution from Python. In TensorFlow, you’ll have to manually code and fine tune every operation to be run on a specific device to allow distributed training. However, you can replicate everything in TensorFlow from PyTorch but you need to put in more effort. Below is the code snippet explaining how simple it is to implement distributed training for a model in PyTorch.

3. Visualization

When it comes to visualization of the training process, TensorFlow takes the lead. Data visualization helps the developer track the training process and debug in a more convenient way. TensorFlow’s visualization library is called TensorBoard. PyTorch developers use Visdom, however, the features provided by Visdom are very minimalistic and limited, so TensorBoard scores a point in visualizing the training process.

Features of TensorBoard
Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Visualizing the computational graph (ops and layers).
Viewing histograms of weights, biases or other tensors as they change over time.
Displaying images, text and audio data.
Profiling TensorFlow programs.
Visualizing training in TensorBoard.
Features of Visdom 
Handling callbacks.
Plotting graphs and details.
Managing environments.
Visualizing training in Visdom.
4. Production Deployment

When it comes to deploying trained models to production, TensorFlow is the clear winner. We can directly deploy models in TensorFlow using TensorFlow serving which is a framework that uses REST Client API.

In PyTorch, these production deployments became easier to handle than in its latest 1.0 stable version, but it doesn’t provide any framework to deploy models directly on to the web. You’ll have to use either Flask or Django as the backend server. So, TensorFlow serving may be a better option if performance is a concern.

5. Defining a Neural Network in PyTorch and TensorFlow

Let’s compare how we declare the neural network in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In PyTorch, your neural network will be a class and using torch.nn package we import the necessary layers that are needed to build your architecture. All the layers are first declared in the __init__() method, and then in the forward() method we define how input x is traversed to all the layers in the network. Lastly, we declare a variable model and assign it to the defined architecture (model  = NeuralNet()).

Keras, a neural network framework which uses TensorFlow as the backend, is merged into TF Repository, meaning the syntax of declaring layers in TensorFlow is similar to the syntax of Keras. First, we declare the variable and assign it to the type of architecture we will be declaring, in this case a “Sequential()” architecture. Next, we directly add layers in a sequential manner using the model.add() method. The type of layer can be imported from tf.layers as shown in the code snippet below.

 

What Can Be Built With PyTorch vs. TensorFlow?

Initially, neural networks were used to solve simple classification problems like handwritten digit recognition or identifying a car’s registration number using cameras. But thanks to the latest frameworks and NVIDIA’s high computational graphics processing units (GPU’s), we can train neural networks on terabytes of data and solve far more complex problems. A few notable achievements include reaching state of the art performance on the IMAGENET dataset using convolutional neural networks implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The trained model can be used in different applications, such as object detection, image semantic segmentation and more.

Although the architecture of a neural network can be implemented on any of these frameworks, the result will not be the same. The training process has a lot of parameters that are framework dependent. For example, if you are training a dataset on PyTorch you can enhance the training process using GPU’s as they run on CUDA (a C++ backend). In TensorFlow you can access GPU’s but it uses its own inbuilt GPU acceleration, so the time to train these models will always vary based on the framework you choose.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: My Recommendation

TensorFlow is a very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. PyTorch, on the other hand, is still a relatively young framework with stronger community movement and it’s more Python-friendly.

What I would recommend is if you want to make things faster and build AI-related products, TensorFlow is a good choice. PyTorch is mostly recommended for research-oriented developers as it supports fast and dynamic training.

Initially, neural networks were used to solve simple classification problems like handwritten digit recognition or identifying a car’s registration number using cameras. But thanks to the latest frameworks and NVIDIA’s high computational graphics processing units (GPU’s), we can train neural networks on terabytes of data and solve far more complex problems. A few notable achievements include reaching state of the art performance on the IMAGENET dataset using convolutional neural networks implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The trained model can be used in different applications, such as object detection, image semantic segmentation and more.

Although the architecture of a neural network can be implemented on any of these frameworks, the result will not be the same. The training process has a lot of parameters that are framework dependent. For example, if you are training a dataset on PyTorch you can enhance the training process using GPU’s as they run on CUDA (a C++ backend). In TensorFlow you can access GPU’s but it uses its own inbuilt GPU acceleration, so the time to train these models will always vary based on the framework you choose.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: My Recommendation

TensorFlow is a very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. PyTorch, on the other hand, is still a relatively young framework with stronger community movement and it’s more Python-friendly.

What I would recommend is if you want to make things faster and build AI-related products, TensorFlow is a good choice. PyTorch is mostly recommended for research-oriented developers as it supports fast and dynamic training.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be state-of-the-art in many cases of supervised learning, but programming an ANN manually can be a challenging task. As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.

With the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.

Using artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.

Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.

The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.

TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.

Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.

TensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.

TensorFlow Advantages
Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.
Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.
Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.
Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).
Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.
Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.
Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.

TensorFlow Disadvantages
Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.
Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.
Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.
GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.
TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
PyTorch Overview

PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.

The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.

PyTorch 2.0

PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.

For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.

Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.

PyTorch Advantages
PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.
Easier to learn.  Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.
Debugging. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).
Dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
Data parallelism. The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores. Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.
Community. PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.
Distributed Training. PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.
PyTorch Disadvantages
Lacks model serving in production. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.
Limited monitoring and visualization interfaces. While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.
Not as extensive as TensorFlow. PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

 

Comparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
1.) Performance Comparison

The following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.

The table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.

2.) Accuracy

The PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.

The validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.

3.) Training Time and Memory Usage

The above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).

While the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.

The memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.

4.) Ease of Use

PyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.

On the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.

Moreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.

 

Differences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary

The answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.

In general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.

PyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.

TensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.

Another major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.

 

Comparison List
Feature	PyTorch	TensorFlow
Ease of Use	More Pythonic syntax and easier to debug	A steeper learning curve requires more boilerplate code
Dynamic Computation Graph	Easier to modify the computation graph during runtime	Static computation graph requires recompilation for changes
GPU Support	Multi-GPU support is easier to set up and use	Multi-GPU support is more complex and requires more setup, there is a TF API
Community Support	Newer community compared to TensorFlow, growing very fast	Large and active community with extensive resources
Ecosystem	Has fewer libraries and tools compared to TensorFlow	Has an extensive library of pre-built models and tools
Debugging	Easier to debug due to Pythonic syntax and dynamic computation graph	Debugging can be more challenging due to the static computation graph
Research	Often used for research due to its flexibility and ease of use	Often used for production applications due to its speed and scalability
Math Library	PyTorch uses TorchScript for tensor manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations	TensorFlow uses its own math library for both tensor manipulation and numerical computations
Keras Integration	PyTorch does not have a native Keras integration	TensorFlow has a native Keras integration which simplifies model building and training

What is PyTorch?

Updated June 1, 2023

 

 

Definition of PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed using Torch library for python programs. It was developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab and released in January 2016 as a free and open-source library mainly used in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing applications. Programmers can quickly build a complex neural network using PyTorch as it has a core data structure, Tensor, and multi-dimensional array like Numpy arrays. PyTorch use is increasing in current industries and the research community as it is flexible, faster, and easy to get the project up and running, due to which PyTorch is one of the top deep learning tools.

Why do we Need PyTorch?

The PyTorch framework can be seen as the future of the deep learning framework. Many deep learning frameworks are being introduced; the most preferred ones are Tensorflow and PyTorch. Still, PyTorch is emerging as a winner due to its flexibility and computation power. For machine learning and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, PyTorch is easy to learn and useful for building models.

Here are some of the reasons why developers and researchers learn PyTorch:

1. Easy to Learn

The developer community has brilliantly documented PyTorch, continuously working to improve its structure, which remains similar to traditional programming. Due to this, it is easy to learn for the programmer and non-programmer.

2. Developers’ Productivity

It has an interface with Python and different powerful APIs and can be implemented in Windows or Linux OS. With some programming knowledge, a developer can improve their productivity as most of the tasks from PyTorch can be Automated.

3. Easy to Debug

It can use debugging tools like pdb and ipdb tools of python. As PyTorch develops a computational graph at runtime, programmers can use Pythons IDE PyCharm for debugging.

4. Data Parallelism

It can distribute the computational tasks among multiple CPUs or GPUs. This is possible using the data parallelism (torch.nn.DataParallel) feature, which wraps any module and helps us do parallel processing.

5. Useful Libraries

It has a large community of developers and researchers who built tools and libraries to extend PyTorch. This community helps develop computer vision, reinforcement learning, and NLP for research and production purposes. Some of the popular libraries are GPyTorch, BoTorch, and Allen NLP. The rich set of powerful APIs helps to extend the PyTorch framework.

PyTorch Components

Let’s look into the five major components of PyTorch:

1. Tensors: Tensors are the Multi-Dimensional array similar to the Numpy array, and Tensors are available in Torch as a torch. IntTensor, torch.FloatTensor, torch.CharTen etc.

2. Variable: A variable is a wrapper around tensors to hold the gradient. The variable is available under torch.autographed as a torch.autograd.Variable.

3. Parameters: Parameters are a wrapper around the variable. It is used when we want a tensor as a parameter of some module which is not possible using a variable as it is not a parameter, or Tensors it does not have a gradient so that we can use parameters under the torch.nn as a torch.nn.Parameter.

4. Functions: Functions perform the transform operations and do not have a memory to store any state. Log functions will give output as log value, and linear layer can not function as it stores weight and biases value. Examples of functions are torch.log, torch.sum, etc., and functions are implemented under the torch.nn.functional.

5. Modules: Module used under Torch as a torch.nn.Module is the base class for all neural networks. A module can contain other modules, parameters, and functions. It can store state and learnable weights. Modules are types of transformation that can be implemented as torch.nn.Conv2d, torch.nn.Linear etc.

Advantages and Disadvantages of PyTorch

Given below are some advantages and disadvantages mentioned:

Advantages
It is easy to learn and simpler to code.
Rich set of powerful APIs to extend the Pytorch Libraries.
It has computational graph support at runtime.
It is flexible, faster, and provides optimizations.
It has support for GPU and CPU.
Easy to debug using Pythons IDE and debugging tools.
It supports cloud platforms.
Disadvantages:
It was released in 2016, so it’s new compared to others, has fewer users, and is not widely known.
Absence of monitoring and visualization tools like a tensor board.
Other frameworks have a larger developer community compared to this one.
Applications of  PyTorch
1. Computer Vision

Developers use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for various applications, including image classification, object detection, and generative tasks. Using PyTorch, a programmer can process images and videos to develop a highly accurate and precise computer vision model.

2. Natural Language Processing

Developers can use it to develop a language translator, language modeling, and chatbot. It uses RNN, LSTM, etc. Architecture to develop natural language processing models.

3. Reinforcement Learning

It is used to develop Robotics for automation, Business strategy planning or robot motion control, etc. It uses Deep Q learning architecture to build a model.

Conclusion

It is one of the primary frameworks for deep learning, Natural Language processing, etc. In the future, there will be more and more researchers and developers will be learning and implementing PyTorch. It has a syntax similar to any other standard programming language; hence, it is to learn and transition into AI or Machine learning engineering.

Are you looking for an efficient and modern framework to create your deep learning model? Look no further than PyTorch!

In this article we'll cover an introduction to PyTorch, what makes it so advantageous, and how PyTorch compares to TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. Then we'll look at how to use PyTorch by building a linear regression model, and using it to make predictions.

Let's get started.

Introduction to PyTorch

PyTorch is a machine learning framework produced by Facebook in October 2016. It is open source, and is based on the popular Torch library. PyTorch is designed to provide good flexibility and high speeds for deep neural network implementation.

PyTorch is different from other deep learning frameworks in that it uses dynamic computation graphs. While static computational graphs (like those used in TensorFlow) are defined prior to runtime, dynamic graphs are defined "on the fly" via the forward computation. In other words, the graph is rebuilt from scratch on every iteration (for more information, check out the Stanford CS231n course).

Advantages of PyTorch

While PyTorch has many advantages, here we'll focus on a core few.

1. Pythonic Nature

As you can see from the graph below, Python is one of the fastest growing programming languages from the last  5-10 years. Most machine learning and artificial intelligence-related work is done using Python. PyTorch is Pythonic, which means that Python developers should feel more comfortable while coding with PyTorch than with other deep learning frameworks. That being said, PyTorch has a C++ frontend as well.

You can also use your favorite Python packages (like NumPy, SciPy, and Cython) to extend PyTorch functionalities when desired.

Source: Stack Overflow
2. Easy to Learn

Like the Python language, PyTorch is considered relatively easier to learn compared to other deep learning frameworks. The primary reason is due to its easy and intuitive syntax.

3. Strong Community

Though PyTorch is a comparatively newer framework, it has developed a dedicated community of developers very quickly. Not only that, the documentation of PyTorch is very organised and helpful for developers.

4. Easy Debugging

PyTorch is deeply integrated with Python, so many Python debugging tools can be easily used with it. For example, the Python pdb and ipdb tools can be used to debug PyTorch code. PyCharm’s debugger also works seamlessly with PyTorch code.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow
Dynamic vs Static: Though both PyTorch and TensorFlow work on tensors, the primary difference between PyTorch and Tensorflow is that while PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, TensorFlow uses static computation graphs. That being said, with the release of TensorFlow 2.0 there has been a major shift towards eager execution, and away from static graph computation. Eager execution in TensorFlow 2.0 evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs.
Data Parallelism: PyTorch uses asynchronous execution of Python to implement data parallelism, but with TensorFlow this is not the case. With TensorFlow you need to manually configure every operation for data parallelism.
Visualization Support: TensorFlow has a very good visualization library called TensorBoard. This visualization support helps developers to track the model training process nicely. PyTorch initially had a visualization library called Visdom, but has since provided full support for TensorBoard as well. PyTorch users can utilize TensorBoard to log PyTorch models and metrics within the TensorBoard UI. Scalars, images, histograms, graphs, and embedding visualizations are all supported for PyTorch models and tensors.
Model Deployment: TensorFlow has great support for deploying models using a framework called TensorFlow serving. It is a framework that uses REST Client API for using the model for prediction once deployed. On the other hand, PyTorch does not provide a framework like serving to deploy models onto the web using REST Client.
PyTorch vs Scikit-Learn

Deep Learning vs Machine Learning: Sklearn, or scikit-learn, is a Python library primarily used in machine learning. Scikit-learn has good support for traditional machine learning functionality like classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering, etc. Sklearn is built on top of Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and is simple and efficient for data analysis. However, while Sklearn is mostly used for machine learning, PyTorch is designed for deep learning. Sklearn is good for defining algorithms, but cannot really be used for end-to-end training of deep neural networks.

Ease of Use: Undoubtedly Sklearn is easier to use than PyTorch. Mostly you will have to write more lines of code to implement the same code in PyTorch compared to Sklearn.

Ease of Customization: It goes without saying that if you want to customize your code for specific problems in machine learning, PyTorch will be easier to use for this. Sklearn is relatively difficult to customize.

The Tensor in PyTorch

PyTorch tensors are similar to NumPy arrays with additional feature such that it can be used on Graphical Processing Unit or GPU to accelerate computing.

A scalar is zero dimensional array for example a number 10 is a scalar.
A vector is one dimensional array for example
10
,
20
10
,
20
is a vector.
A matrix is two dimensional array.
A tensor is three or more dimensional array.
However, it is common practice to call vectors and  matrices as a tensor of dimension one and two respectively.

The main difference between a PyTorch Tensor and a numpy array is that a PyTorch Tensor can run on Central Processing Unit as well as Graphical Processing Unit. If you want to run the PyTorch Tensor on Graphical Processing Unit you just need to cast the Tensor to a CUDA datatype.

CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by Nvidia. It allows developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit.

Creating a Regression Model

Linear Regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithm that is great for implementing as it is based on simple mathematics. Linear regression is based on the mathematical equation of a straight line, which is written as y = mx + c, where m stands for slope of the line and c stands for y axis intercept.

Linear regression residuals and data analysis

As you can see in the above image we have data points represented in red dots and we are trying to fit a line that should represents all the data points. Note that all the red data points may not be on the straight line, however our aim is to find the  straight line that best fits all the data points. And finding that best fit straight line essentially means finding the slope m and intercept c, as these two parameters can define a unique line. Note that here x is called independent variable and y is called dependent variable.

Assumptions of Linear Regression

There is five important assumption for linear regression.

Linear regression assumes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear.
The data is normally distributed
Independent variables (if more than one)  are not correlated with each other.
There is no auto-correlation in the data. Auto-correlation is observed when the residuals are dependent on each other.  For example, for stock price data the price is dependent on the previous price.
Data is homoscedastic, which means the residuals are equal across the regression line.
Prerequisites to Build the Model

You can install numpy, pandas and PyTorch using the commands below.

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

Note that after installing the PyTorch, you will be able to import torch as shown below.

Importing Libraries
PyTorch Linear Regression Loading data
Defining the Model

Let us start defining our model by creating a class called MyModel as shown below. Inside the class MyModel we need to define two methods named forward and init. After that we will create the instance of the class MyModel and the instance name here is my_lr_model.

Defining Linear regression model in PyTorch
Training the Model

Now we are ready for training the model. Before we start the training we need to define loss function ( here MSELoss), optimizer (here SGD or stochastic gradient descent), and then we have to assign learning rate (0.011 in this case) and momentum (0.89).

The learning rate also called step size is a hyper-parameter which decides how much to change the machine learning model with respect to the calculated error every time the model weights are changed.

Momentum is a hyper-parameter which accelerate the model training and learning rate which results in faster model convergence. By default momentum is set to zero.

In PyTorch a Variable is a wrapper around a Tensor. Thus Variable supports nearly all the API’s defined by a Tensor.

Once these parameters are defined we need to start the epochs using for loop. Note how the loss value is changing with each epoch.

Training the model of Linear Regression using PyTorch
Prediction

After the model is trained, the next step is to predict the value of a test input. Here we consider an input value of 4.0, and we get a prediction (output) of 21.75.

Note that for feeding the input value to the model we need to convert the float value in tensor format using the torch.Tensor method. Hence we tested that our model is working and giving the output as well.

Predicting the value using Linear regression model in PyTorch
In Summary

In this tutorial we learned what PyTorch is, what its advantages are, and how it compares to TensorFlow and Sklearn. We also discussed tensors in PyTorch, and looked at how to build a simple linear regression model.

☑️Strong Community and Industry Support: With backing from Meta and a vibrant community, PyTorch continuously evolves with contributions from both academic researchers and industry professionals.

What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow, another powerhouse in the AI domain, is a framework primarily developed by Google for machine learning and neural network research.

Origins and Development

Launched in 2015, TensorFlow originated from Google’s internal research for its products and services. It evolved from an earlier framework called DistBelief and was designed to be more flexible and efficient.

Key Features

TensorFlow has several notable attributes:

✔️Graph-Based Computation: TensorFlow works on a graph-based computation model, which means operations are represented as nodes in a graph of data flows. This approach can efficiently utilize CPU and GPU resources.

✔️Scalability: TensorFlow is known for its scalability, capable of running on both desktops and large-scale distributed systems.

✔️Versatile API: TensorFlow provides multiple levels of abstraction, making it suitable for beginners (through high-level APIs like Keras) and experts alike.

✔️TensorBoard: A unique tool for visualization, TensorBoard helps in understanding and debugging models.

✔️Broad Adoption and Community Support: As a product of Google, TensorFlow has been widely adopted in industry and academia, benefiting from a large community of developers and researchers.

The Battle of Features
➡️Ease of Use

PyTorch: Known for its Pythonic nature and simplicity, PyTorch often appeals to beginners for its intuitive syntax and ease of understanding. It mirrors Python’s way of doing things, making it accessible to those familiar with it. Users often commend PyTorch for its straightforward approach to building and training neural networks, especially with its dynamic computation graph, which allows for changes on the fly. This makes experimenting and debugging relatively easier for beginners. 

A beginner in PyTorch remarked, “I found it quite straightforward to translate my Python knowledge into building simple models in PyTorch.”

Get started with Pytorch

TensorFlow: Historically, TensorFlow was considered to have a steeper learning curve, primarily due to its static computation graph and more verbose syntax. However, this has changed significantly with the introduction of Keras as a high-level API within TensorFlow. Keras provides an easier entry point for beginners with its user-friendly interface. TensorFlow’s recent versions have focused on improving user-friendliness, but it might still be perceived as more challenging initially than PyTorch. 

A new TensorFlow user mentioned, “It took me some time to get the hang of TensorFlow’s way of defining models, but the extensive documentation and community support were immensely helpful.”

➡️Flexibility and Design Philosophy

PyTorch: PyTorch’s design is centered around flexibility and user-friendliness. Its dynamic computation graph (eager execution) allows developers to change the behavior of their models on the fly and use native Python control flow operations. This dynamism is particularly suited for complex, iterative model architectures where changes are frequently made. 

It’s like molding clay – you can shape and reshape your model as you go.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow, on the other hand, uses a static computation graph, which requires the definition of the entire model architecture upfront before any actual computation occurs. This approach, while less flexible than PyTorch’s, allows for more straightforward optimization of the models, potentially leading to better performance at scale. 

TensorFlow’s philosophy is akin to constructing a building – you need a detailed blueprint before building.

➡️Impact on Practical Model Building:

PyTorch: The flexibility of PyTorch makes it ideal for research and prototyping, where the ability to tweak and adjust models rapidly is crucial. However, this flexibility can sometimes lead to less optimized models than TensorFlow, particularly for deployment in production environments.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow’s structured approach is beneficial for production environments where models must be scalable and highly optimized. However, this can sometimes slow down the experimentation process, making it less ideal for research purposes where rapid prototyping is required.

Bottomline:

PyTorch might be more appealing for beginners, and researchers focused on experimentation and learning. Conversely, TensorFlow could be the more suitable choice for those looking to deploy scalable and optimized models in production.

➡️Speed and Efficiency

Benchmark Test Scenario: Imagine we’re training a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a standard dataset like MNIST. The CNN will have a few convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The performance metrics to focus on are training time and memory usage.

Results (Hypothetical): 

In such a test, you might find that PyTorch and TensorFlow perform similarly in terms of training speed when running on a GPU. However, variations can occur based on the specific version of the framework and the hardware used. For instance, TensorFlow might slightly edge out in GPU utilization efficiency due to its static graph nature, which the underlying engine can more easily optimize.

Resource Usage: TensorFlow might show a bit more efficiency in memory usage compared to PyTorch, especially in larger and more complex models, thanks to its graph optimizations. PyTorch, with its dynamic graph, might consume more memory for the same task.

➡️Scalability

PyTorch: PyTorch is highly scalable and is being increasingly adopted for large-scale applications. Its dynamic nature doesn’t hinder its scalability. With the introduction of features like TorchScript and PyTorch’s ability to support distributed training, it’s capable of handling large-scale deployments. However, the dynamic graph can add overhead in some cases, especially when scaling to very large models or data sizes.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is renowned for its scalability, particularly in production environments. It excels in situations involving large datasets and complex neural network architectures. TensorFlow’s static computation graph can be optimized for different hardware configurations, making it a robust choice for enterprise-level, large-scale machine learning projects. TensorFlow’s support for distributed training and TensorFlow Serving for model deployment are also key factors in its scalability.

Bottomline:

Both frameworks offer competitive performance and scalability, with TensorFlow having a slight edge in optimization and resource management for large-scale projects, while PyTorch provides flexibility that can be advantageous in rapidly changing and experimenting scenarios. The choice between them should be influenced by the specific needs of the project, such as the size of the model, the complexity of the tasks, and the deployment environment
