Retrieval Augmented Generation
What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?

Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architectural approach that can improve the efficacy of large language model (LLM) applications by leveraging custom data. This is done by retrieving data/documents relevant to a question or task and providing them as context for the LLM. RAG has shown success in support chatbots and Q&A systems that need to maintain up-to-date information or access domain-specific knowledge.

What challenges does the retrieval augmented generation approach solve?
Problem 1: LLM models do not know your data

LLMs use deep learning models and train on massive datasets to understand, summarize and generate novel content. Most LLMs are trained on a wide range of public data so one model can respond to many types of tasks or questions. Once trained, many LLMs do not have the ability to access data beyond their training data cutoff point. This makes LLMs static and may cause them to respond incorrectly, give out-of-date answers or hallucinate when asked questions about data they have not been trained on.

Problem 2: AI applications must leverage custom data to be effective

For LLMs to give relevant and specific responses, organizations need the model to understand their domain and provide answers from their data vs. giving broad and generalized responses. For example, organizations build customer support bots with LLMs, and those solutions must give company-specific answers to customer questions. Others are building internal Q&A bots that should answer employees' questions on internal HR data. How do companies build such solutions without retraining those models?

Solution: Retrieval augmentation is now an industry standard

An easy and popular way to use your own data is to provide it as part of the prompt with which you query the LLM model. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. Instead of relying solely on knowledge derived from the training data, a RAG workflow pulls relevant information and connects static LLMs with real-time data retrieval.

With RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.

What are the use cases for RAG?

There are many different use cases for RAG. The most common ones are:

Question and answer chatbots: Incorporating LLMs with chatbots allows them to automatically derive more accurate answers from company documents and knowledge bases. Chatbots are used to automate customer support and website lead follow-up to answer questions and resolve issues quickly.
Search augmentation: Incorporating LLMs with search engines that augment search results with LLM-generated answers can better answer informational queries and make it easier for users to find the information they need to do their jobs.
Knowledge engine — ask questions on your data (e.g., HR, compliance documents): Company data can be used as context for LLMs and allow employees to get answers to their questions easily, including HR questions related to benefits and policies and security and compliance questions.
What are the benefits of RAG?

The RAG approach has a number of key benefits, including:

Providing up-to-date and accurate responses: RAG ensures that the response of an LLM is not based solely on static, stale training data. Rather, the model uses up-to-date external data sources to provide responses.
Reducing inaccurate responses, or hallucinations: By grounding the LLM model's output on relevant, external knowledge, RAG attempts to mitigate the risk of responding with incorrect or fabricated information (also known as hallucinations). Outputs can include citations of original sources, allowing human verification.
Providing domain-specific, relevant responses: Using RAG, the LLM will be able to provide contextually relevant responses tailored to an organization's proprietary or domain-specific data.
Being efficient and cost-effective: Compared to other approaches to customizing LLMs with domain-specific data, RAG is simple and cost-effective. Organizations can deploy RAG without needing to customize the model. This is especially beneficial when models need to be updated frequently with new data.
When should I use RAG and when should I fine-tune the model?

RAG is the right place to start, being easy and possibly entirely sufficient for some use cases. Fine-tuning is most appropriate in a different situation, when one wants the LLM's behavior to change, or to learn a different "language." These are not mutually exclusive. As a future step, it's possible to consider fine-tuning a model to better understand domain language and the desired output form — and also use RAG to improve the quality and relevance of the response.

When I want to customize my LLM with data, what are all the options and which method is the best (prompt engineering vs. RAG vs. fine-tune vs. pretrain)?

There are four architectural patterns to consider when customizing an LLM application with your organization's data. These techniques are outlined below and are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they can (and should) be combined to take advantage of the strengths of each.

Method	Definition	Primary use case	Data requirements	Advantages	Considerations


Prompt engineering

	Crafting specialized prompts to guide LLM behavior	Quick, on-the-fly model guidance	None	Fast, cost-effective, no training required	Less control than fine-tuning


Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

	Combining an LLM with external knowledge retrieval 	Dynamic datasets and external knowledge	External knowledge base or database (e.g., vector database) 	Dynamically updated context, enhanced accuracy	Increases prompt length and inference computation


Fine-tuning

	Adapting a pretrained LLM to specific datasets or domains	Domain or task specialization	Thousands of domain-specific or instruction examples	Granular control, high specialization	Requires labeled data, computational cost


Pretraining

	Training an LLM from scratch	Unique tasks or domain-specific corpora	Large datasets (billions to trillions of tokens)	Maximum control, tailored for specific needs	Extremely resource-intensive

Regardless of the technique selected, building a solution in a well-structured, modularized manner ensures organizations will be prepared to iterate and adapt. Learn more about this approach and more in The Big Book of MLOps.

What is a reference architecture for RAG applications?

There are many ways to implement a retrieval augmented generation system, depending on specific needs and data nuances. Below is one commonly adopted workflow to provide a foundational understanding of the process.

Prepare data: Document data is gathered alongside metadata and subjected to initial preprocessing — for example, PII handling (detection, filtering, redaction, substitution). To be used in RAG applications, documents need to be chunked into appropriate lengths based on the choice of embedding model and the downstream LLM application that uses these documents as context.
Index relevant data: Produce document embeddings and hydrate a Vector Search index with this data.
Retrieve relevant data: Retrieving parts of your data that are relevant to a user's query. That text data is then provided as part of the prompt that is used for the LLM.
Build LLM applications: Wrap the components of prompt augmentation and query the LLM into an endpoint. This endpoint can then be exposed to applications such as Q&A chatbots via a simple REST API.

Databricks also recommends some key architectural elements of a RAG architecture:

Vector database: Some (but not all) LLM applications use vector databases for fast similarity searches, most often to provide context or domain knowledge in LLM queries. To ensure that the deployed language model has access to up-to-date information, regular vector database updates can be scheduled as a job. Note that the logic to retrieve from the vector database and inject information into the LLM context can be packaged in the model artifact logged to MLflow using MLflow LangChain or PyFunc model flavors.
MLflow LLM Deployments or Model Serving: In LLM-based applications where a third-party LLM API is used, the MLflow LLM Deployments or Model Serving support for external models can be used as a standardized interface to route request from vendors such as OpenAI and Anthropic. In addition to providing an enterprise-grade API gateway, the MLflow LLM Deployments or Model Serving centralizes API key management and provides the ability to enforce cost controls.
Model Serving: In the case of RAG using a third-party API, one key architectural change is that the LLM pipeline will make external API calls, from the Model Serving endpoint to internal or third-party LLM APIs. It should be noted that this adds complexity, potential latency and another layer of credential management. By contrast, in the fine-tuned model example, the model and its model environment will be deployed.

These advanced systems are all about understanding user intent and delivering results that truly resonate.

So, what’s on the horizon for 2025. Let’s explore how AI search engines are transforming digital marketing and what this means for businesses striving to connect with their audience in a more meaningful way.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Search Gets Conversational

NLP is a driving force behind the AI search revolution. This technology allows machines to interpret and respond to human language in a contextually relevant way. As we step into 2025, expect AI search engines to take NLP to the next level, making interactions even more conversational and nuanced.

For small business owners, this is a big win. As AI search engines sharpen their understanding of context, slang, and even local dialects, your content will naturally align better with user expectations. Imagine your SEO strategy being able to capture the subtle nuances in how people talk, not just how they type.

This will also be a game-changer for voice search, where NLP is crucial. As voice-activated assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant grow in popularity, optimizing content for spoken queries will open new doors for businesses looking to tap into this booming market.

Machine Learning and Personalization – Tailored Just for You

When it comes to AI, machine learning is all about evolution—analyzing behavior, preferences, and interactions to create personalized experiences. AI search engines are now capable of tailoring results to individual users based on their unique history and behavior patterns.

What does that mean for businesses? More chances to connect. Imagine being able to reach your audience at precisely the right moment with the exact content they’re looking for. Whether it’s product recommendations, content suggestions, or personalized experiences, machine learning helps businesses stay relevant and top-of-mind.

Using platforms like SEMRush and Google Analytics, you can monitor user behavior in real-time, helping to predict trends and optimize content strategies accordingly. These platforms give insight into what your audience is searching for, allowing you to tailor your website and content development for better results.

Deep Learning and Contextual Understanding – AI That “Gets It”

AI search engines aren’t just looking at keywords anymore—they’re reading between the lines. Thanks to deep learning, search engines now understand the true intent behind searches, even when users aren’t specific.

This shift is a huge opportunity for businesses. AI search engines powered by deep learning will understand broader search terms, making it easier for businesses to capture traffic from users who might not phrase their queries perfectly. Additionally, deep learning expands the scope for visual search.

Challenges and Considerations: AI Isn’t Without Its Flaws
Data Privacy and Security


As AI search engines collect more data to personalize results, businesses must ensure strong data privacy and security practices. This includes safeguarding user information, being transparent about data usage, and staying compliant with regulations like GDPR. Building trust through transparency and security is essential in today’s AI-driven world.

Algorithm Bias


You’ve probably heard that AI and algorithms are revolutionizing everything from hiring to loan applications. But here’s the thing: even though we think of AI as objective, the reality is that it can be just as biased as the people who create it. That’s where algorithm bias comes into play.

Algorithm bias happens when an AI system unintentionally favors certain groups or disadvantages others. This could be based on race, gender, age, or any other factor. The reason? Often, it comes down to the data that the algorithm was trained on. If the data has built-in biases or doesn’t represent a diverse population, the AI will reflect those same patterns.

How Does Algorithm Bias Happen?
Biased Training Data: If the AI’s training data is flawed—say it reflects historical inequalities—then the AI will learn those biases and repeat them in its results.
Lack of Representation: When certain groups aren’t represented enough in the data, the algorithm struggles to make fair decisions about them.
Faulty Design: Sometimes it’s not even about the data. If the people building the algorithm don’t account for bias, it can show up in the system’s logic and outcomes.

Algorithm bias is more than just a technical issue—it has real-world consequences. It can affect who gets hired, who gets a loan, or who gets recognized by a machine. And it’s up to businesses, developers, and everyone working with AI to make sure we don’t reinforce existing inequalities.

At Don Creative Group, we believe that data-driven decisions should be both innovative and fair. That’s why we’re always mindful of how we build, train, and monitor AI systems.

Embrace the Future

AI search engines are no longer just a glimpse of the future—they’re shaping the present. As they continue to evolve, businesses that embrace these technologies will be better positioned to engage with their audience, optimize their content, and stay ahead of their competition.

With tools like Google Search, You.com, and ChatGPT-based searches leading the way, the future of AI-powered search engines is bright. Now is the time to adapt, innovate, and make AI search work for you.

Final Thoughts

But first things first: what exactly is an AI tech stack? Simply put, it’s the collection of tools, AI frameworks, and platforms that you use to develop AI applications. Think of it as the foundation of a skyscraper; without a solid base, the whole structure is at risk.

The 2024 McKinsey Global Survey reveals a significant increase in AI adoption, rising from around 50% over the past six years to 72% this year, highlighting a growing global interest and implementation. As more organizations embrace AI, having a robust tech stack becomes essential for staying competitive, ensuring efficient development, and maintaining high performance in AI applications.

Components of AI Tech Stack

Building an AI system involves a multifaceted tech stack, with each layer playing a critical role in the development, deployment, and maintenance of robust AI solutions. Let’s break down the core components.

AI Infrastructure



Whether it’s CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, or specialized hardware, the backbone of any AI infrastructure lies in robust compute resources. Ensuring swift and efficient processing, these powerhouses enable the training and inference tasks vital for model development and deployment.

Effective storage solutions, such as SSDs and distributed storage systems, house large datasets and model artifacts. They guarantee quick access and retrieval capabilities for seamless data and model management.

High-speed networking infrastructure paves the way for efficient data flow and coordination among disparate components, fostering a cohesive and responsive AI ecosystem.



Data Collection and Storage



Any AI project begins with raw data. Data may be collected from databases, APIs, sensors, and web scraping, among others. These sources provide the necessary data to train and evaluate AI models.

To collect, aggregate, and preprocess data from any source, we use data ingestion tools. For example, solutions like AWS Kinesis, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, and Databricks enable seamless data ingestion and ensure data is consistently fed into the system for analysis and model training.

Efficiently storing and managing large volumes of structured and unstructured data is crucial. There are several scalable storage solutions available for AI applications, including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

For instance, in developing the AI-driven speech analytics solution, we extensively leveraged Azure computing services for their robust data storing, processing capabilities, and scalable infrastructure. Azure services were particularly instrumental in efficiently managing large volumes of data, so the resulting solution completely fulfilled client requirements in terms of functionality and usability.



Data Preparation and Feature Engineering



Once raw data is collected and stored, the next phase is data preparation and feature engineering. It involves:

data cleansing, which removes noise, handles missing values, and validates and standardizes the data.
feature engineering, the process of creating or transforming features to improve model performance.
data transformation techniques such as normalization, scaling, and encoding.



These steps are vital to ensure the data is clean, relevant, standardized, and ready for effective AI model training.



Modeling and Training



With prepared data in hand, the next phase is modeling and training, where the real magic of AI happens. This stage involves selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models, and fine-tuning them to achieve optimal performance.

Choosing the right algorithm is crucial and depends on the problem domain. Supervised learning algorithms, such as regression and classification, work best with labeled data, helping predict outcomes based on input features. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms, like clustering, excel with unlabeled data, identifying patterns and groupings. Reinforcement learning is ideal for tasks requiring sequential decision-making, where a user learns optimal actions through trial and error.

For complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, we use deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras. These frameworks provide the tools necessary to build and train neural networks, enabling models to learn from vast amounts of data.

Optimizing hyperparameters is essential for boosting model performance. Automated and manual techniques like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization come to the rescue. They aid in pinpointing the most effective hyperparameters and ensure a model excels when faced with unseen data.

When it comes to evaluating model performance, we employ metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for supervised learning models. For unsupervised models, silhouette scores or clustering metrics are utilized.



Deployment and Serving



When a model is trained and evaluated, what’s next? Here comes deploying it into production environments and making it accessible for real-world use.

Deploying a trained model requires setting up infrastructure and software components to host the model and handle incoming requests. We opt for technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless computing services to provide scalable and efficient deployment solutions.

To guarantee seamless integration with other applications or systems, we expose the model as an API or microservice. It allows developers to interact with the model programmatically, making predictions or obtaining insights in real-time.

On top of that, we ensure the deployed models can manage diverse workloads and sustain performance across different scenarios, employing scalability strategies like load balancing, auto-scaling, and resource optimization.



Monitoring and Management



After deployment, we proceed with continuous model monitoring and management to detect any deviations from expected behavior or performance degradation. Monitoring tools such as PowerBI, Datadog, AWS QuickSight, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Weights & Biases (W&B) track various metrics, including model accuracy, latency, and resource utilization.

To keep stakeholders informed about any anomalies (such as data and model drift) or critical events in real-time, we implement robust alerting mechanisms. Additionally, logging relevant information ensures traceability and simplifies post-mortem analysis in cases of incidents or failures.

With model versioning and management, organizations can maintain the integrity of their AI systems and guarantee traceability and reproducibility. For example, version control systems like DVC help track changes and updates to models.



Development and Collaboration Tools



As vital AI tech components, development environments like Jupyter Notebooks, PyCharm, and other IDEs provide platforms for writing, testing, and experimenting with code. These tools improve productivity and allow for interactive exploration of data and models.

To track changes and manage the codebase, we leverage version control systems like Git. They allow us to maintain the integrity of the AI development project and facilitate collaboration among team members.



Clusters



Clusters are crucial in the deployment and scalability of machine learning models, particularly for high-throughput and real-time inference use cases. Establishing a cluster-based architecture can give organizations significant benefits, such as enhanced scalability and high availability. Clusters ensure optimal resource utilization, allowing for efficient handling of varying workloads. They offer flexibility and portability, making adapting to different environments and requirements easier.

Data in AI Tech Stack

Data stands as the cornerstone of AI development, shaping the trajectory of machine learning models. It serves as the raw material from which models glean insights, discern patterns, and make predictions. Moreover, the quality of data directly impacts model performance and aids in addressing biases to foster equitable and precise decision-making.



The GIGO Concept



GIGO, “garbage in, garbage out,” stands as a vital concept in machine learning and data-driven systems. It underscores the necessity of high-quality, relevant, and accurate input data to guarantee the reliability and effectiveness of a model’s predictions or outputs.

At Coherent Solutions, we adhere strictly to this rule, recognizing that the quality of input data directly impacts the performance of our models. By prioritizing data integrity, we ensure that our machine learning solutions deliver precise and valuable insights. This commitment to GIGO helps maintain the trust and satisfaction of our clients.

1. Structured data

Ever wondered what makes structured data so valuable? Well, it’s all about organization. Structured data adheres to a predefined schema and is commonly housed in databases or spreadsheets. Its organized nature renders it easily searchable and analyzable, making it ideal for traditional statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms alike.

2. Unstructured data

Everyone who encountered unstructured data knows it’s like navigating a maze without a map. Unstructured data, comprising text, images, videos, and audio files, lacks a predefined structure. Analyzing it demands advanced techniques such as natural language processing and computer vision to extract meaningful insights from this diverse array of information.

3. Semi-structured data

A blend of order and chaos. That’s what semi-structured data is. It exhibits some organizational properties but doesn’t adhere to a rigid schema. Examples include JSON and XML files. This type of data offers flexibility in storage and retrieval and is commonly employed in web applications and NoSQL databases for its adaptable nature.

4. Temporal data

Ever considered the significance of temporal data? It’s all about the timestamps. Temporal data comprises time-stamped information like stock prices, sensor readings, and event logs. Analyzing this data entails deciphering trends, patterns, and correlations over time, indispensable for tasks like forecasting and predictive modeling.

5. Spatial data

Exploring the world through spatial data is akin to having a digital globe at your fingertips. Spatial data encompasses geographic information such as maps, satellite images, and GPS coordinates. Analyzing spatial data requires spatial indexing, geocoding, and spatial analysis techniques to unveil spatial relationships and patterns. This data is instrumental in applications like urban planning and environmental monitoring, offering insights into geographical phenomena that shape our world.

With evolving AI, businesses still face one major challenge- how to ensure that AI-generated responses are accurate, relevant, and tailored to specific queries?

Traditional language models rely on training data that can further lead to generic and inaccurate answers. On the other hand, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline addresses this problem by combining information retrieval and response generation.

RAG development services help generate the perfect response by searching external knowledge sources to find relevant data and using large language models to produce accurate responses.

This blog will help you understand everything about RAG, from its components to benefits and challenges, as well as how to build a RAG pipeline.

Key Takeaways
RAG pipelines enhance accuracy by retrieving relevant data before generating responses, reducing errors, and enabling precise, domain-specific answers.
Steps for building a RAG pipeline include defining use cases, preprocessing data, embedding for retrieval, integrating with a language model, and refining for accuracy.
Optimize embeddings, choose the right vector store, use effective chunking, and maintain a feedback loop to improve response relevance for smooth implementation.
Common challenges include data consistency, model alignment, integration complexity, and error handling. Robust management and fine-tuning are essential.

To begin with, we need to understand the RAG pipeline in detail.

What is a RAG Pipeline?

Image source

RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, is a method in Artificial Intelligence that combines two steps: retrieving information and generating responses. In simple terms, it first searches a knowledge source to find relevant information based on the users’ questions.

Then, it uses LLM like GPT and more to create a detailed and context-aware response. This approach helps the AI to provide accurate and informed answers, especially for complex or specific queries.

Components of RAG Pipeline

Components of a RAG pipeline include the following:

Embedding Model

It generates query embeddings from the input query, transforming the text into a dense vector representation that can be used to find relevant data in vector stores.

Vector Stores

This component stores and organizes embeddings for quick access and retrieval based on similarity scores. When a query is processed, vector stores help locate the most relevant documents or passages.

Text Splitter and Chunking

Chunking or splitting large documents into manageable sections helps the RAG pipeline efficiently process and retrieve relevant information by enabling more precise retrieval and generation.

Large Language Model (LLM)

Uses retrieved chunks and prompts engineering to generate responses. The LLM combines retrieved data with its own generative capabilities, guided by specific hyperparameters to balance response quality and relevance.

Utility Functions and Visualization Tools

Utility functions assist with tasks like scoring and ranking retrieval results, while visualization tools provide insights into retrieval and generation processes, helping users and developers understand and refine the pipeline.

It is always a question of whether businesses should invest in RAG pipelines and what types of companies should. To answer this question, we have explained the benefits of RAG pipeline LLM in the section below.

Benefits of RAG Pipelines

As technology evolves, it is crucial for brands to integrate these into their daily operations in order to automate and save time and money. RAG pipeline is one such tech. Some of its vital benefits include:

Contextually Relevant Responses

By integrating retrieval-augmented generation, the pipeline pulls contextually relevant data from external sources. It helps provide precise answers rather than relying solely on general information from the model.

Enhanced Accuracy Through Document Extraction

The RAG pipeline uses document extraction to locate and leverage specific pieces of information from large datasets to ensure accurate responses even for detailed, domain-specific queries.

Domain-Specific Question-Answering

By retrieving external data as context, the pipeline enables domain-specific question-answering tailored to particular industries or knowledge areas, making it a highly versatile solution for specialized use cases.

Reduced Hallucinations in Responses

With real-time retrieval and LlamaIndex integration, the RAG pipeline reduces hallucinations (fabricated or inaccurate responses) by grounding answers in verified data rather than purely relying on the model’s assumptions.

Improved Generative Capabilities with Large Language Models

The RAG pipeline leverages the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which, combined with retrieved data, produce responses that are not only accurate but also well-structured and nuanced.

Question-Answering and Real-Time Retrieval

The use of TruLens enhances real-time evaluation and feedback mechanisms, allowing for more reliable question-answering in real-time retrieval scenarios.

Now that you know how RAG pipelines can benefit in various ways, the next section explains how to build a RAG system.

How to Build a RAG Pipeline?

The next question is how to build a RAG pipeline that helps businesses solve specific problems. Here is the step-by-step process.

Define Use Case and Knowledge Base

The first step in building a pipeline is identifying the use cases. Determine the purpose of the RAG pipeline, such as customer support and research assistance.

Once you have identified the use cases, choose or create a data source like documents, articles, or structured databases from which the pipeline will retrieve information from.

Preprocess and Index Data

Next, use a text splitter to divide large documents into smaller and manageable sections or “chunks” for easier retrieval. Then, an embedding model is used to convert text chunks into vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.

Once done, store these embeddings in a vector store like Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

Build the Retrieval System

The next step to building a RAG pipeline is using query embedding. For each new query, you can use the same embedding model to convert it into a query embedding. Further, perform a similarity search within the vector store to retrieve the most relevant text chunks based on similarity scores.

Integrate with a Language Model

To integrate the pipeline with a language model, send the retrieved text chunks along with the query to an LLM, structuring it into a prompt that the model can use as context. The LLM will then generate a response, informed by the retrieved data, to ensure it is contextually accurate.

Evaluate and Optimize the Pipeline

Next, functions for scoring and ranking retrieved results should be added to ensure the most relevant data is used in the generation. In order to add a feedback loop, you can use tools like TruLens to adjust parameters and reduce “hallucinations.”

Adjust hyperparameters to tune model settings, chunk sizes, and similarity thresholds to improve response quality and retrieval accuracy.

Deploy and Monitor Performance

The last step is to deploy and implement the RAG pipeline within your application or API. Further, use tools for logging and visualizing performance in order to refine the model as needed for a better user experience.

Best Practices for Implementing a RAG Pipeline

In order to ensure that the RAG pipeline performs well, it is important to integrate it well with the existing systems. Here are some best practices for implementing the RAG pipeline:

Optimize Embedding Models for Relevance

Carefully select and fine-tune your embedding model to improve the quality of retrieved data. As this model is responsible for converting text into vectors, you must choose an embedding model that aligns with your data type and domain.

Select the RIght Vector

Each vector has unique strengths, from speed to scalability. Hence, choosing the right vector store is essential. You must evaluate factors like latency, query speed, and integration compatibility with your existing tech stack to find the best fit.

Chunk Text Strategically

For smooth integration, you must also divide large documents into manageable “chunks” or segments to increase retrieval accuracy. Also, ensure that chunks are the right size and experiment with these to see which balance works best with your knowledge base.

Maintain a Continuous Feedback Loop

Next, keep a continuous feedback loop as it allows for regular improvements by adjusting the RAG pipeline based on user interaction and responses. It also helps address issues like hallucinations and irrelevant responses.

Challenges With RAG Pipeline

Integrating a RAG pipeline with the existing businesses comes along with some challenges and these include:

Data Consistency

Maintaining consistent and high-quality data across various sources can be challenging, especially when integrating structured and unstructured data. Inconsistent data can lead to poor retrieval results and inaccurate generative outputs.

Complexity in Data Retrieval

Efficiently retrieving relevant information from large and diverse datasets can be difficult. Ensuring that the retrieved data matches the user query or context is crucial for generating accurate responses.

Model Alignment

Aligning retrieval models with generative models requires fine-tuning to ensure that the information pulled from the database or knowledge base is properly synthesized. Misalignment can lead to irrelevant or incorrectly generated content.

Integration Complexity

Integrating the RAG pipeline with existing systems can be complex, especially when dealing with legacy systems or incompatible software. Ensuring seamless communication between components is key to a smooth integration process.

Error Handling

Errors in either the retrieval or generation phase can lead to faulty outputs or system failures. Developing a robust error-handling mechanism is crucial to prevent disruption and ensure continuous, reliable performance.

“The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don’t really even notice it, so it’s part of everyday life.”  

– Bill Gates

Artificial Intelligence is everywhere—helping you shop online, giving directions, or even recommending movies. But have you ever stopped to think about what makes it all work? There’s a whole tech stack behind it, kind of like a layered cake.

At the bottom of the AI tech stack, you have data—the raw material every AI needs to learn. Next are algorithms, the math that processes and makes sense of all that data. Frameworks sit above, simplifying the development process for you. Finally, the applications bring it all together—the parts you interact with, like your phone’s voice assistant or a self-driving car.

Here’s a fact to put things into perspective: the global AI market is set to grow at a staggering 36.6% annually, reaching $1,811.75 billion by 2030. That’s how fast AI is becoming indispensable in every field.

In this blog, we’ll help you understand the AI technology stack. You’ll learn about the tools, techniques, and trends shaping the future of AI—and how you can keep up.

Understanding the AI Technology Stack: What Sets It Apart?

An AI technology stack is the backbone of modern artificial intelligence systems, combining multiple layers to enable intelligent decision-making. To truly understand the AI technology stack, think of it as a carefully structured framework that powers AI applications—from voice assistants to predictive analytics.

The AI technology stack refers to a multi-layered architecture, comprising data, algorithms, frameworks, and applications, each playing a critical role in building AI solutions.

Purpose of the AI Technology Stack

The AI technology stack makes building and scaling AI systems easier and faster. It’s like a toolkit that brings everything—data, models, and applications—together to work seamlessly. 

Let’s break it down for you:

1. Integration

The stack connects all the moving parts, so your data flows smoothly into models, and those models power real-world applications. It cuts the complexity for you.

2. Scalability

Got more data coming in as your business grows? The stack can handle it without breaking a sweat, adapting to bigger workloads effortlessly.

3. Adaptability

Unlike older systems, this stack evolves on its own. It learns from fresh data and keeps improving, so you’re always ahead.

4. Efficiency

Why waste time on repetitive tasks? The stack takes care of things like cleaning data or fine-tuning models, so you can focus on more impactful work.

5. Driving Innovation

With ready-made tools and frameworks, the stack helps you try out new ideas quickly. It lowers the barrier so you can move from concept to execution faster.

How Does It Compare to a Traditional Tech Stack?

AI tech stacks are designed to handle complexities beyond traditional tech stacks. Here’s how they differ:

Aspect	Traditional Tech Stack	AI Technology Stack
Focus	Static systems with fixed inputs and outputs.	Adaptive systems that learn and evolve.
Data Processing	Predefined, rule-based.	Continuous learning with vast datasets.
Tools	Standard coding frameworks.	AI-specific frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Flexibility	Limited adaptability.	Highly scalable and flexible.
Core Components	Servers, databases, and basic software tools.	Data pipelines, ML models, and advanced frameworks.
Use Cases	Transaction processing, reporting, web apps.	Predictive analytics, NLP, and intelligent automation.

To understand the AI technology stack, you need to see how each layer contributes uniquely to creating smarter, more adaptive systems.

Layers of the AI Technology Stack: Building Smarter Systems

To truly understand the AI technology stack, it helps to break it down into its individual layers. Each one plays a unique role, working together to create the magic behind AI systems. 

Let’s take a closer look at these layers to see how they make businesses smarter, more agile, and future-ready.

1. Data Layer: The Bedrock of AI

Everything in AI starts with data—raw, messy, and often unorganized. This is where the journey begins. The data layer in the AI software stack is responsible for collecting, storing, and cleaning the data so it’s ready for use.

What it does: It gathers data from various sources such as customer behavior logs, IoT sensors, or even social media posts.
Why it matters: High-quality data is the foundation of all AI systems. In fact, Gartner found that poor data quality costs businesses a shocking $12.9 million annually.
Example: Imagine an e-commerce website using customer purchase histories to recommend personalized products. This not only boosts engagement but also drives higher sales because it’s tailored to the user’s preferences.
2. Algorithm Layer: The Problem-Solver

Once the data is ready, the algorithm layer comes into play. To understand the AI technology stack, think of this layer as the “brain” of the AI system—it processes the data, makes sense of it, and drives decisions based on its findings.

What it does: It transforms raw data into insights through powerful tools like machine learning models, neural networks, or decision trees.
Why it matters: Algorithms are what make AI smart. They help solve complex problems far quicker than humans can. For instance, OpenAI‘s models (like GPT-4) process billions of data points to generate highly accurate responses.
Example: To better understand the AI technology stack, consider how banks use algorithms to spot fraudulent transactions in real-time. They monitor spending patterns and flag anything that seems off, helping prevent fraud before it happens.
3. Framework Layer: The Developer’s Toolbox

Building AI from scratch is no small feat. That’s where frameworks come in—they simplify the process by providing pre-built, ready-to-use tools. These frameworks are essential for understanding the AI technology stack, as they make development faster, easier, and more efficient.

What it does: Frameworks offer libraries and modules to simplify complex tasks. For example, TensorFlow helps with deep learning, and Scikit–learn assists with data analysis.
Why it matters: With frameworks, developers don’t have to reinvent the wheel. They can use powerful, pre-built tools to focus on creating innovative solutions instead of writing basic code.
Example: A healthcare provider might use PyTorch (a popular deep learning framework) to develop AI models that analyze medical images and detect early signs of disease. This makes the process of diagnosing much faster and more accurate.
4. Application Layer: The End-User Interface

Finally, we reach the application layer. In understanding the AI technology stack, this is where everything comes together and transforms into something users can interact with. Whether it’s a virtual assistant, a chatbot, or a recommendation engine, this layer brings AI to life.

What it does: It translates the AI’s power into something practical by delivering it through apps or APIs that users can actually interact with.
Why it matters: Without this layer, AI would just be a bunch of code. It’s the application layer that makes AI accessible and actionable for users, allowing businesses to implement AI into real-world solutions.
Example: Think about a smart home system that adjusts your thermostat and lights based on your daily routines. It makes your life easier and more energy-efficient by learning your preferences over time.

Every layer builds on data—let’s see how it shapes the backbone of AI systems.

Data in the AI Tech Stack: Laying the Foundation

Data is at the heart of every AI system, forming the foundation of any AI stack. Without it, AI is just an idea. It’s like fuel for an engine—without it, nothing works.

Types of Data: Structured, Unstructured, and Semi-Structured

To understand how data works in AI, it’s important to know the types of data you’re dealing with. Here’s a breakdown of each one:

1. Structured Data

Think of this as the neat, organized data—like rows and columns in a spreadsheet or a database table. Understanding this structure is crucial to understand the AI technology stack, as it allows data to be easily read and processed in specific formats like numbers, dates, and strings.

Example: Customer names, phone numbers, and transaction amounts are all examples of structured data. It’s easy to sort, analyze, and process.

2. Unstructured Data

This is the messy data that doesn’t fit into a neat table. It’s all over the place and can come in various formats—like text, images, or videos. Unstructured data is harder to process and analyze because there’s no specific format.

Example: A collection of social media posts, customer reviews, or video files are unstructured data. It’s a goldmine for AI but requires more work to analyze.

3. Semi-Structured Data

This is a mix of both structured and unstructured data. It doesn’t fully follow the traditional table format but has some degree of organization. Gaining clarity on this type of data is key to understanding the AI technology stack, as it bridges the gap between rigidly organized and completely unstructured data formats.

Example: Emails or XML files are semi-structured. They have some tags or labels to separate data but aren’t as neatly organized as structured data.

Before AI can use data, it needs to be prepared.

Data Preprocessing: Cleansing, Transformation, and Augmentation

You might be wondering why data preprocessing is such a big deal in AI. The reason is simple: AI systems can only perform as well as the data they are trained on. If the data is messy, incomplete, or inaccurate, the AI will make poor predictions or decisions. 

That’s why spending time on cleansing, transforming, and augmenting the data is essential. To truly understand the AI technology stack, you must recognize that high-quality, well-prepared data forms the foundation of an effective AI system. The cleaner the data, the better the results.

1. Cleansing

Cleansing removes inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values. This ensures the data is accurate and reliable for analysis.

Example: Removing duplicate entries in customer databases helps AI recommend the right products without errors.

2. Transformation

This step converts data into a usable format, such as normalizing numbers or converting text into numerical values for machine learning models.

Example: A finance company transforms transaction logs into formats that its fraud detection algorithms can easily read.

3. Augmentation

This involves enhancing the dataset by adding new information or generating synthetic data.

Example: In image recognition, data augmentation might include flipping or rotating images to teach AI systems to recognize objects in various scenarios.

Here’s the thing: AI doesn’t stay perfect forever. To truly understand the AI technology stack, you must see the importance of regular updates, fine-tuning, and monitoring for models to stay relevant. Without MLOps, you’d spend more time fixing problems than building solutions.

MLOps in AI Tech Stack: Making AI Work in the Real World

This post is written for companies who gain visibility (and money 💰️) from search today.

I define search as getting information via technology = Google search + AI are in the same bucket.

Results

I focus on Google vs AI tools in this post. Other search engines are left out in the data.

I like to start with the results. If you want to dig into how I reached these numbers, it is all covered at the end in section 4, including link to a spreadsheet.

How big the market share of all AI tools compared to Google currently?

We have approximate data from sources such as Similarweb, Statista, Datos and many others.

I have collected the data and it results in this graph:

In 2024 all AI tools have around 6% share of the search market. And actually this number is declining from a 2023 high.

I project AI usage to grow up to 35% yearly from 2025. This is optimistic. It will lead to a 14% share of the search market by 2028.

Then Google will have a 86% share of the search market compared to all AI tools by 2028

Will this mean Google will lose traffic and revenue?

Actually no. They will keep growing even if they lose market share. Because the search market is currently growing at roughly 8% yearly.

From 2022-2028 the combined search market (all AI + Google) will expand 40,6%

This graph shows Googles + AI chats historical and predicted searches per day:

Can we directly compare AI use and searches per day? No, not directly. I have converted it. These numbers are rough estimates. See section 4.

 

Will websites lose search traffic?

If we talk about all websites globally combined, I don’t believe they will. Not before 2028.

On an individual level It depends on what category of search you are currently in.

You can divide search into 2 categories:

informational search: When you search to learn. Example: “How do I delete cells in Excel?”
Money search: When you search to buy or compare products and services.

Learn more in my tiny guide 😊

 

My prediction is that AI chats will mainly eat information search share from Google (and therefore also traffic from some websites):

 

And if we look at money search, this is my prediction:

AI will take a way smaller piece of the pie, and websites should expect continued growth:

 

AI doesn’t eat the market – it expands it

The above graphs might look like a scenario where search is declining. But above graph shows traditional search is growing faster than it’s losing market share to AI. So at least when it comes to money search, I see no decline.

When I look at all the data my take is that AI chats expands the search market or even creates an entire new market. Recent AI usage data from Davos and Rand Fishkins brilliant commentary (August 2024) reach the same conclusion.

Prediction by year
2024
🔮 Prediction:
Google will have a tough first year with AI search since they play catch up (US launch in May)
Traditional search will keep growing. Google will do record revenue on search ads.
📊 Traffic share:
AI like ChatGPT: 6% of informational search
AI like ChatGPT: 1% of money search
Total search market growth: 4%

 

2025
🔮 Prediction:
Use of AI apps for phones and computers like ChatGPT and Copilot for Windows will accelerate
This will start to eat more informational and money search from Google
But mainly it will expand the market. Google will still grow
📊 Traffic share:
AI like ChatGPT: 7% of informational search
AI like ChatGPT: 3% of money search
Total search market growth: 3.5%
2026
🔮 Prediction:
AI apps like ChatGPT’s app and Copilot for Windows will grow even faster
“Private AI” can be deeply integrated on your computers and phones
Google back in top-3 of AI race and start getting a serious piece of the AI search pie
📊 Traffic share:
AI like ChatGPT: 9% of informational search
AI like ChatGPT: 4% of money search
Total search market growth: 2%
2027
🔮 Prediction:
AI search will be mainstream at this point
20% of the time you search via a chatbot and 80% you simply want to go from A to B – especially for money search
Which means the classic A-B “Google search” with a list of results will still be 80% of search
This A to B will be powered by AI to give you highly relevant options (Google search on steroids)
📊 Traffic share:
AI like ChatGPT: 11% of informational search
AI like ChatGPT: 5% of money search
Total search market growth: 1%
2028
🔮 Prediction:
AI is now just a part of all devices and your search
You no longer think about the difference between “Googling” and “chatting”
Websites will start losing up to 20% traffic
But companies will at the same time gain brand visibility in search results = no change in visibility
📊 Traffic share:
AI like ChatGPT: 13% of informational search
AI like ChatGPT: 6% of money search
Total search market growth: 1%

 

What happens to your websites traffic in 2028?
🔻If you rely on informational guides like “how to format numbers in Excel” you can expect increasing losses year after year
💲If you keep expanding your brand and aim for money search via money keywords you will prosper
💲If you produce informational content that is opinionated and personal, there is a big chance AI cannot eat you
💲If you produce great personally guiding videos on for example YouTube your brand and search traffic will keep growing
🔻If AI becomes super intelligent and takes over the world, yeah well, our websites won’t matter I guess 😅

 

How I reached these results

All data used for this article are 3rd-party estimates from respected sources.

Mainly Statista, Similarweb and these articles:

https://backlinko.com/chatgpt-stats
https://backlinko.com/bing-users

You can also view my Spreadsheet with all data

 

Annual growth rates: Google search
Google search growth rates from 2020-2023 are based on historical data

We see a steady decline in the growth rate of search, since it’s a maturing technology.

From 2024 and onwards I have attributed growth to be low based on AI stealing market share.

Very conservative growth, since I want to avoid bias towards search.

Google		
Year	Billion searches/day	Traffic growth
2020	6.00	
2021	6.55	9.1%
2022	7.09	8.3%
2023	7.64	7.7%
2024	7.94	4.0%
2025	8.22	3.5%
2026	8.38	2.0%
2027	8.47	1.0%
2028	8.55	1.0%
AI searches per day calculation

All AI search engines combined receive roughly 2 million visits per month vs Bing 1.3 millions.

On top of that AI apps on desktop + mobile also account for additional usage.

+20% is a big overestimation based on data I could find, but I will use that number.

2.4 million “visits” total once +20% mobile usage is factored in.

We know the search share of Bing is 3,4% of the entire search engine market.

Based on the above we can simulate how big usage of AI is compared to search engines:

2,4 million visits per month / 1,3 millions on Bing = 185% * current 3,4% Bing market share.

6.3% of Googles search market and 6% of combined market in 2023

AI chat bots			
Year	Billion searches/day	Traffic growth	Ai market share
2020			0.0%
2021			0.0%
2022	0.02		0.3%
2023	0.49	2343.5%	6.0%
2024	0.50	2.0%	5.9%
2025	0.67	35.0%	7.6%
2026	0.91	35.0%	9.8%
2027	1.18	30.0%	12.2%
2028	1.42	20.0%	14.2%

 

Annual growth rates: AI

You can see my estimated growth rates in the table above (Traffic growth collumn).

Actually AI has dropped traffic since it’s peak of 2023 – from 1.8 to 1.3 billion visits.

I expect things to pick up a little speed after Summer 2024 so the year will end in small growth.

(Actually I don’t expect that, but I want to calculate the best case scenario for AI growth)

Which also means my growth expectation from 2025 is VERY optimistic for AI.

Especially considering Google starts to incorporate AI results in it’s search results.

If Google can eventually catch up on ChatGPT’s quality it might stunt ChatGPT’s growth

But I doubt Google can fully kill the leader of a new category: AI search

What I find more likely to happen is that over time ChatGPT will get 10-20% market share

 

Conclusion
I don’t see how Google in the next 5 years will decrease revenue from search.

In the biggest hype for AI ever, they are still growing their search revenue significantly:


Source: Alphabet Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results (PDF)

It is way more likely that the market simply expands

This has already happened as far as I can see:

ChatGPT plus has around 3.9 million paid subscribers in US alone and OpenAI revenue is $2 Billion.

This tells you that informational search and automation is now worth a monthly subscription if it’s great enough.

ChatGPT will become the kings of research and automation.

Google will stay kings of remaining search.

Table:
Googles share of search by category (prediction):

Year	Money search	Information search
2022	100%	100%
2023	99%	95%
2024	99%	94%
2025	97%	93%
2026	96%	91%
2027	95%	89%
2028	94%	87%

How AI will affect the future of search
Explore the transformative role of AI in search engines and discover how it will affect the future of search, shaping marketing strategies.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the digital landscape – leaving no room for outdated SEO tactics. As search engines increasingly leverage AI to anticipate user intent, we must completely rethink our strategies and balance human creativity and AI efficiency to stay ahead. 

Let’s explore the innovations, opportunities and pitfalls to master as AI propels search into a new era.

Search evolution: Prioritizing intent over keywords

The era of keyword stuffing is over, replaced by a focus on user intent. 

Search engines have evolved to understand the context behind queries. This shift demands a change in SEO strategies – prioritizing creativity and relevance over mere keyword density.

Today’s SEO is about aligning with user goals and pain points, not just keyword counts. Including elements like location-based services and personalized recommendations turns searches into dynamic interactions between users and your content.

Embracing semantic search

Incorporating semantic search requires a mix of data analytics and empathetic writing. This approach focuses on delivering relevant and valuable insights, aligning with E-E-A-T guidelines for expertise and trustworthiness.

In this new landscape, keyword research remains valuable but as part of a wider strategy. It’s about creating meaningful interactions and standing out in a digital world filled with information overload.

Consider Google’s BERT algorithm. It uses natural language processing to understand the real intent behind a search. This is a leap from simple keyword matching to predictive, context-aware results. 

This essentially means AI doesn’t just improve search – it anticipates our needs, often before we articulate them. 

AI does more than just understand user intent. It also brings personalization to search engines. 

By analyzing past user data like location and search history, AI can predict the future preferences of search engine users.

AI’s transformative role in SEO

AI is a pivotal force in digital marketing, making it important for content creators to understand the technology. 

It involves machine learning algorithms that analyze data to predict relevant content for search queries. 

With search engines like Google and Bing employing AI to enhance result accuracy, marketers must understand AI’s impact to remain competitive.

Leveraging AI for advanced content strategies

AI tools offer more than just enhancements to current strategies. 

They enable optimization through trend identification and advanced analytics. These tools provide insights into strategy performance, like click-through rates and page engagement. 

AI also suggests improvements based on user behavior, revolutionizing content optimization by revealing new opportunities and offering data-driven recommendations for continuous enhancement.

The balance between man and machine: The future trend?

Despite AI’s advancements, the need for human narrative crafting remains. 

This balance is where concepts like AIO and my C.R.A.F.T framework become crucial, merging machine learning with human intuition to produce compelling, search engine-friendly content.

Artificial intelligence optimization (AIO) in content creation

AI’s role in content creation marks a new era. Enter AIO writers.

It starts with AI drafting content, embedding keywords, and aligning with search engine results pages. But AI alone is not enough. A human writer trained in AIO takes over next. They take AI drafts and make them better. 

These optimized pieces attract readers and meet the criteria of modern search algorithms. They keep the language and brand voice unique.

The interesting thing about this model isn’t just about quantity. I am talking about accuracy and trustworthiness, which are essential for any high E-E-A-T content strategy. 

Marketers who embrace AIO in their strategy are leading the way – not keeping up.

Synergy of AI and human expertise in SEO

AI boosts efficiency, but the nuanced touch of human writing brings depth and appeal to the content. This collaborative process involves using AI for initial drafts and human skills for final refinements. 

Today, creating SEO-friendly content requires a careful approach. AI lays a solid groundwork, but human skill is what makes content stand out.

What C.R.A.F.T. is all about

I developed the C.R.A.F.T. framework to steer content creators in a rapidly changing digital environment, especially when working with AI-generated content. 

AI writing isn’t ready to publish as is. It lacks your personal experiences, client insights, and unique tone.

That’s where C.R.A.F.T. comes in. It empowers writers to infuse AI content with these essential human elements and ensures your content reflects you and your audience.

Here’s what it looks like. 

Cut the fluff

C.R.A.F.T. centers on concise, impactful writing. Eliminating excess words is essential in today’s information-saturated world. 

This approach aligns with Google Search Essentials (formerly Webmaster Guidelines), which prioritizes valuable content for users.

Review, edit, optimize

Transform good writing into great communication. Refine syntax and strategically integrate keywords, balancing SEO with reader appeal.

Add images, visuals, media

You need visuals. They enrich your text and help explain complex ideas. Alt tags and clear visuals also contribute to SEO by enhancing user experience and search indexing. 

Fact-check your content

Fact-checking establishes authority and combats misinformation. Truth is our responsibility as creators, reflecting Google’s E-E-A-T principles.

Trust-build

This involves adding personal stories and authoritative links to build trust with your readers.

Generative AI’s role in search results

Generative AI is redefining content ranking based on quality. This advancement challenges traditional SEO tactics, as algorithms can now create and assess content unprecedentedly.

Elevating quality standards across the board

In this competitive arena, high-quality standards become paramount. 

Google’s evolving algorithm updates now prioritize relevant, original and useful content – mirroring the objectives of generative AI.

This shift calls for stringent fact-checking and authenticity in content creation. 

Enhancing user experience through AI

Generative AI impacts more than just search rankings. It influences creative storytelling, tone differentiation, and user engagement metrics. 

The narrative around facts enhances user experience, as authoritative links within content add credibility.

However, despite AI’s advanced capabilities, the essential human element in content creation cannot be overlooked.

The blend of technology and the innate human touch in crafting compelling narratives is irreplaceable.

Adapting to AI-driven search engine marketing

The future of search engine marketing is rapidly evolving with AI advancements. Marketers must stay informed and prepare for this change. Here are key strategies:

Stay updated on AI trends: Keep abreast of the latest AI developments. Subscribe to trade publications and engage in professional discussions about AI trends and technologies. 
Understand AI challenges: Recognize AI’s opportunities and pitfalls. Generative AI, while promising, raises concerns like misinformation. Up to 80% of marketers will need teams dedicated to countering AI-generated misinformation by 2027, Gartner predicts.
Consider copyright concerns: Copyright issues are paramount with generative AI. After the 2023 ruling by the U.S. Copyright Office, navigating copyright becomes more complex, especially with AI-generated content. The ruling reminds us to make sure we humanly edit AI-generated output to maintain the human stamp and ownership of our content.
Be aware of regulatory changes: Monitor the evolving regulatory landscape for AI technologies. Anticipate and prepare for inevitable regulatory actions affecting AI use.

Marketers need to stay informed, understand challenges, navigate copyright issues, and maintain regulatory awareness to thrive in the AI-driven future of search engine marketing.

Integrating human expertise with AI in search technology

Merging human expertise with AI is becoming crucial in optimizing for search. 

This combination is not just helpful – it’s essential to master modern search algorithms.

AI brings immense processing power but lacks human-like, nuanced understanding. Marketers need to use their insights to refine AI results. This leads to a more focused approach that matches user intent, boosting efficiency.

This fusion also helps predict consumer behavior shifts that data alone might miss. Combining metrics with human empathy ensures digital strategies connect personally with users.

Creativity and predictive analytics: A powerful duo

Creativity is a core human factor and the key to standing out in a crowded market. 

When blended with AI’s predictive analytics, creativity becomes both original and data-driven, maximizing impact.

We see this partnership in action when analyzing metrics like click-through rates. Human creativity is the factor to lean into to build interest and curiosity, while AI can optimize reach based on these insights.

Making better decisions with AI and human insight 

AI is great at quickly spotting patterns helping in SEO decision-making. 

But without human strategic oversight, AI alone might miss opportunities that need human cultural understanding or trend identification.

Professionals must use AI tools to enhance, not replace, their decision-making. This approach allows for quick yet well-thought-out strategic choices.

Shaping the future of search with AI

AI is reshaping search. It’s changing how we create content, adapt to algorithms, and stay ahead in marketing. The future of search isn’t just about keywords – it’s about understanding and utilizing AI.

Remember the milestones that got us here. Keep my C.R.A.F.T framework handy as you refine your SEO approach: Cut through the noise, enhance with custom visuals, and build trust with authentic stories.

Understand how to function in the role of AIO – AIOs are not just helpers; they’re co-creators. Generative AI is not a threat but an ally for those who learn to collaborate effectively.

The takeaway? How AI will affect the future of search hinges on our ability to blend human ingenuity with machine efficiency. Master this, and the way forward is bright.

AI-powered search engines are challenging traditional search solutions and forcing marketers to rethink SEO strategies and how they engage users.
The Gist

The rise of AI search. AI-powered search engines are reshaping traditional search and offering more organized and relevant results. 

Google’s dominance. Despite the rise of AI search, Google remains dominant with its vast data advantage, making it difficult for competitors to catch up.

SEO shifts ahead. As AI-powered search engines evolve, SEO strategies must adapt, focusing on user intent rather than traditional keyword strategies.

Will AI replace search? These AI platforms are changing the capabilities of search, but it's uncertain if they can take over established search platforms.

Search has had a good run. It’s been the ultimate cash cow for decades. But will AI kill traditional search as we know it?

Google's search algorithm has been in use since the launch of Google's search engine on September 4, 1998. Google handles more than 8.5 billion search queries on a daily basis, and there are approximately 6.3 million searches conducted on Google every minute.

The original algorithm, called PageRank, was created by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. PageRank ranked search results based on the number and quality of links to a page. PageRank operated "by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is.” The underlying assumption was that more important websites were likely to receive more links from other websites.

This changed the way people would use the internet forever.

As generative AI platforms begin to launch their own AI-powered search engines, every major search engine — including Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft’s Bing and Baidu in China — are scrambling to add their own generative AI capabilities to their search platform to avoid disruption.

Will this be enough to preserve the monopoly search has had on the internet? Will these tools remain separate or converge over time? And what does this mean for marketers?

Google’s Rise to the Top
Google Wasn’t the First

Early on, many companies were in the search game, including Archie, Lycos, AskJeeves, WebCrawler, Yahoo, Infoseek, AltaVista and others. These first search engines were pretty basic and were frequently simple directories of websites that were split into topic categories, allowing users to source information they required from relevant websites. This worked fine when the internet was a small community of servers, but when it grew, it became harder to manually index information. Automated web crawlers were introduced, capable of scanning an entire web page and indexing its content for search engine users.

The decades that followed saw search engines become more sophisticated, with a focus on optimizing search results for relevance and speed. Users could now receive millions of results for a query within a split second, which has led to our reliance on search engines today. Mobile devices quickly became the primary device used to access the internet and forced the creation of responsive websites. As algorithms evolved, new disciplines like SEO, search engine marketing and advertising emerged. This ultimately led to the creation of a global $980 billion advertising market dominated today by Google.

Why Did Google Win?

It’s not just one capability that catapulted Google to success; it was a series of deliberate choices. Most important was relevance and speed. The platform had high performance and produced relevant search results very quickly. Google also indexed more web pages, and therefore it had more search results than any other search platform.

Google also focused on simplicity. Its interface was minimalistic and clean with a simple search box on a web page. All other search engines had very cluttered interfaces with banner ads and other distractions.

Why Hasn’t Anyone Caught Up to Google?

For starters, Google's main focus as a company has been to build the best search engine in the world. Focus and investment can drive amazing market results.

Google also benefits from a data advantage. Most search engine algorithms rely on past user data to power their algorithms. Because of Google’s market share, they consistently had five to six times the data to analyze and use for its algorithms. All things being equal, bigger and better data wins over better algorithms. This means even if a search platform uses the exact same algorithms as Google, they will still not perform as well because of less data.

Lastly, Google was the first to understand what customers truly wanted. They continued to evolve and innovate the search engine experience by introducing new features like RankBrain to improve relevance, Mobilegeddon to encourage mobile-friendly websites, Possum to attack local spam sites, Hummingbird to understand human intent, and BERT and the Multitask Unified Model (MUM) to understand complex search queries.

These innovations have made it difficult for other search competitors to scale.

Google’s Competition Has Struggled to Compete
Building Search Engines Is Hard

Big companies like Microsoft have put significant investments into their search platform Bing, and they still have under 10% market share. Meanwhile, between 2014 and 2024, Google has maintained an average 85% market share in search.

Startups Have Also Struggled to Compete

Some startups have been trying for years. DuckDuckGo is an internet search engine founded by Gabriel Weinberg in 2008. It made a brand around protecting user privacy. They don’t collect or store your personal information, and they don’t target you with ads. Its default setting is private. It comes with over a dozen powerful privacy protections built-in and doesn't track search history. They have managed to survive and service over 3 billion searches a month; they even turned a profit in 2014. However, they have struggled to get more than 1% in market share.

More recently, Neeva — an ad-free search engine that focused on protecting user privacy and avoiding bias — gained early momentum but had to shut down in June 2023.

Neeva set out to be an ad-free environment through a paid subscription model. Instead of having to scroll through numerous sponsored results to get to relevant links, Neeva delivered what it deemed to be the most relevant results at the top of the page.

Another selling point was the ability to filter out specific information sources. For example, if you didn’t want to buy from Amazon, you can tell Neeva to not include it in future results.  

Traditional search engine experiences are cluttered with ads, pop-ups and algorithm-optimized content. When your business model relies on ad-based revenue, it’s hard to maintain purity as the information portal to the web. The signature “10 blue links” are so buried in advertisements that it consumes many cycles to get to valuable content, and it creates a frustrating user experience in the process.

However, this was not enough to sway a user base from traditional search engines.

Neeva founder Sridhar Ramaswamy, who worked at Google for 16 years and ran its ad business, finally recognized that, “It’s one thing to build a search engine and an entirely different thing to convince regular users of the need to switch to a better choice.”

AI-Powered Search Engines Transforming the Search Landscape

AI is now changing the search game, most likely forever.

It’s not surprising that OpenAI entered the search engine game. They already had a partnership with Bing, and it was only a matter of time before they went after Google.

SearchGPT is OpenAI’s prototype search engine launched in July 2024. And OpenAI officially rolled out ChatGPT Search late last month. This much-anticipated feature provides more organized and meaningful search results by summarizing and contextualizing information rather than returning lists of links. SearchGPT is trying to improve user experience, introducing new paradigms like the sidebar which provides more links relevant to the search query. OpenAI unified the SearchGPT to the ChatGPT interface.

Maybe the future of web searching lies in a hybrid between traditional search and AI search. For example, Perplexity was founded in August 2022, and it offers a different kind of experience when browsing the web. It offers a web search alternative using AI-powered research coupled with a custom search engine to generate more precise answers to queries.

Perplexity is powered by several large language models (LLMs), blending foundational LLMs with proprietary ones. The paid version offers access to many models, including GPT, Sonar Lage and Claude versions. Perplexity integrates a web crawler with LLMs using its own web crawler, PerplexityBot. Perplexity can therefore perform two core functions, both acting as a search engine and generating original content.

Perplexity’s strength is in complex queries that would require a lot of navigation and summarization. Perplexity focuses on speed and accuracy, with the goal of making people save time, compared to Google where you quickly get a results list but need to spend time to find the right answer.

Perplexity really shines with LLM-friendly queries such as “how-to guides,” complex summarization and complex questioning. When you ask a question, Perplexity doesn’t give you back a list of links. Instead, it scours the web for you and uses AI to write a summary of what it finds. These answers are annotated with links to the sources the AI used, which also appear in a panel above the response. These source links are invaluable for fact-checking and academic research, ensuring credibility and easy verification

Search Is About More Than Just Getting Answers

While AI-powered search engines may certainly be better at summarizing information related to specific research queries, it’s not necessarily able to perform all the functions of today’s search engines.

Google is much more than just a research tool. For many, it’s the portal to the internet. For instance, if customers want to go to their bank’s website, they’ll frequently bring up Google and type their bank name rather than entering the name of the bank URL into the browser. When you do a navigational Google search like this, it’s exceedingly rare that the first result isn’t what you’re looking for.

AI-powered search engines are not very good at navigational queries. They like to think for a few seconds and then provide a stream of information about the company when all you want is a link.

Traditional search also excels at real-time information like “today’s weather,” “NFL scores” and “current time in London.” Google presents accurate information quickly, but AI search takes a few seconds and can sometimes give outdated information like last night’s scores or yesterday’s weather.

Over the past several years, Google Search has been experimenting with ways to give users more instant answers by providing companion results to the traditional search engine results page (SERP). An example is the “Google Answer Box,” a snippet that sits above all organic search results and provides quick and easy answers to queries by providing a snippet of content from one of the result pages. The Answer Box has become the holy grail for SEO platforms to target as the propensity to click on answers in the box is much higher.

Another key feature is “People Also Ask” (PAA), which is a snippet offering users additional information related to their initial query. Google pulls the answers from relevant websites and presents them as snippets, along with a link to the original website. The answers are presented in various formats such as paragraphs, lists, images, tables or even videos.

These are typically presented as other questions for users to ask to explore their search topic further. When you click on a question, the answer appears below it. It also triggers more questions to appear, which you can expand by clicking on the down arrow icon. This process can frequently get you to your desired answer faster.

Through these search capabilities, traditional search engines are now trying to deliver quicker, more direct answers, similar to how AI-powered search engines work.

The Third-Party Cookie Saga Continues

The saga of the end of third-party cookies took on a new life as Google announced in July 2024 that it would indefinitely delay the removal of third-party cookies from Chrome. This was a significant reversal of policy after years of delays,

Third-party cookies are pieces of tracking codes placed on a user’s computer when they visit a website, and they trigger re-targeted ads when a user visits other websites. These cookies have become the standard for advertising and tracking purposes, allowing advertisers to track user behavior across multiple websites.

Google’s alternative plan to third-party cookies, the Privacy Sandbox initiative, aimed to create technologies that both protect people's privacy online and give companies and marketers tools to build advertising campaigns to grow their businesses. Recent experiments to assess the impact of third-party cookie removal were mixed.

The way that Privacy Sandbox works is that your information doesn't leave your computer. As you browse the web, your web browser adds categories of interest -– for example car shopping, clothing or food. When advertisers want to sell an ad, they go to Google and request a specific ad be sent to all the people in your category of interest. The problem here is that customer information is a lot less granular and specific. Advertisers are finding this really lowers their profits.

Key findings from enabling the Privacy Sandbox showed positive results for conversion-focused campaigns, with a 97% recovery in conversion per dollar (CPD) in Google Display Ads. However, remarketing results showed only a 55% spend recovery in Google Ads due to the remarketing reliance on third-party cookies. This is likely a big factor in the reversal decision.

This reversal comes at an interesting time when AI-powered search engines are beginning to threaten the lucrative ads business. Advertisers have expressed concerns that eliminating cookies from Chrome would restrict their capacity to gather data for ad personalization. Fewer ads means less revenue.

As the digital landscape evolves, there’s a growing emphasis on privacy, leading to changes in how third-party cookies are used and regulated. Privacy advocates are not happy and are likely to continue to put pressure on regulation that forces an end to third-party cookies. 

Other browser makers have been able to cut off support for third-party cookies without issue. In 2019, Mozilla Firefox started blocking such cookies by default. Apple’s Safari began blocking third-party cookies by default in March 2020, with the major update to its Safari Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). They introduced a privacy feature that allows the company’s web browser to block cookies and prevent advertisers from tracking your web habits.

Why have others removed third-party cookies but Google has not? That’s the million-dollar question, but one can assume that Google is worried about ad revenue cannibalization. Other browser companies are not as concentrated in ad revenues.

The elimination of third-party cookies creates challenges for both traditional search tools and new AI-powered search engines. Without access to extensive browsing data, AI algorithms will need to rely more on first-party data collected directly by websites.

How AI-Powered Search Engines Are Shaping the Future of Search

While AI may not immediately kill traditional search, it will undoubtedly force traditional search engines to rethink their approach to the search experience. Ironically, AI is likely to be a catalyst for enhancing the capabilities of traditional search engines.

AI will help search engines develop more sophistication as they leverage core AI platforms to better understand user intent, personalize results and summarize information. They will be context-aware and will leverage that context for better search results. AI will deeply integrate multi-modal search with images, voice, video and text to create seamless search experiences.

Traditional marketing models will get disrupted by AI search. The era of keyword stuffing is likely coming to an end, replaced by a focus on user intent. As AI-powered search engines evolve to better understand user intent, SEO strategy will shift from focusing on keyword counts to leveraging location-based services.

In the end, AI and search engines are likely to remain companions and not direct competitors. Users want the best of both worlds -– the ability to use generative AI to begin a search and then use search results to dive deeper into a topic.

In the near future, some users will use generative AI often, some will use it intermittently, and others won’t use it at all. But everyone will continue to use search.

The world of search is undergoing a massive transformation, driven by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI models. Like most, I have been closely monitoring these developments and their potential impact on the search landscape. 

In a recent post on AI and SEO, I wrote about the evolution of search behaviors and the development of new generative AI-based experiences. Today we see a massive influx of new investment and innovations from traditional and non-traditional search players, signaling that we are entering the next generation of search and AI. 

You can learn more on How AI is reshaping Google’s search page via Fast Company.

The Evolution of Search in a Post-Generative AI World 

One of the most significant changes we are witnessing is the integration of AI into search engines. Generative AI models, like ChatGPT and others, make the average searcher much more proficient at finding relevant information. These models can take a single keyword and expand it into multiple related queries, providing a comprehensive and well-summarized search experience. 

This is a momentous change for the end user, as it enhances their ability to find what they are looking for.

Search engines can utilize AI to take a single search query and turn that into many formats of answers. They do this is by assembling the entire related areas of conversation, run those searches, summarize that with the AI, and give you a well-researched and summarized point of view. As I mentioned in an interview with Forbes recently, it makes the average person that searches 100 times better at search.

Moreover, the rise of AI-powered search engines has created a massive opportunity for disruption in the industry. Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are investing heavily in developing their own AI-driven search experiences. 

Each of these players brings unique assets and capabilities to the table, setting the stage for a new era of innovation and competition in search.

Last week I had a great conversation with Kanad Bahalkar, Co-founder of Potion. I want to summarize our discussion on how AI is reshaping search and what it means for businesses, entrepreneurs, and marketers.

 

 

 

As AI continues to advance, I believe we will see search engines become increasingly specialized in different use cases. 

Google, for example, has a strong advantage in real-time indexing, location-based information, and user reviews. On the other hand, platforms like Perplexity are focusing on the research use case, providing powerful tools for citation and information summarization.

Just as people today use different search engines for specific purposes (e.g., Google for general queries, Amazon for products, YouTube for videos), I anticipate that the AI-driven search landscape will further fragment, with users turning to different AI engines for diverse types of searches. 

I share more of my thoughts on this below, including BrightEdge Generative Parser™ research on Perplexity showing 40% MoM growth in referrals. 

Read more: Perplexity’s growth upends SEO fears, reveals crack in Google’s dominance, VentureBeat. 

The Importance of Being an Authority

For businesses and marketers, the rise of AI in search underscores the importance of being an authoritative source in your domain. As AI models become more adept at surfacing and citing the most relevant and trustworthy information, it is crucial to establish your brand as a go-to resource in your area of expertise.

This means doubling down on your core competencies and creating high-quality, informative content that highlights your unique value proposition. Whether it is Google's AI engine or Perplexity's, if you are consistently producing valuable content in your niche, you will be well-positioned to be cited as an authoritative source.

The Challenges of Content Moderation

Of course, the integration of AI into search also presents new challenges, particularly in the realm of content moderation. As platforms like Reddit begin licensing their datasets to train large language models, questions arise about how to effectively police the quality and appropriateness of the content being used.

 

 

Moreover, as AI engines start to assert their own informed opinions and present pros and cons for various queries, there is a risk of bias and misinformation. Striking the right balance between surfacing diverse perspectives and maintaining accuracy and credibility will be a key challenge for AI-powered search engines moving forward. This is something I discussed with the team at TheNewStack just last week. 

The Future of Search and AI is Bright 

I am incredibly excited about the future of search and the role that AI is playing in shaping it. We are entering a new era of innovation and disruption, where the boundaries of what is possible are being pushed every day. 

At BrightEdge we are committed to helping you stay at the forefront of these developments and helping businesses navigate this rapidly evolving landscape.

By understanding the implications of AI for search, focusing on your core strengths, and consistently producing high-quality, authoritative content, you can position your brand for success in the age of AI-powered search. 

The future is bright, and I cannot wait to see what it holds.

Summary
My testing process
1. Perplexity
2. Google AI Overviews
3. ChatGPT Search
4. Bing AI
I rigorously tested the most popular AI search engines to discover their strengths and weaknesses.

 

I ran this test for two reasons:

As a human being, I want to use the best search engine around. I spend my life on the internet. I want to find information in the fastest, most effortless way possible.
As a marketer, I want to know where the tide is headed. Will AI search engines replace “traditional” search engines? Are AI chatbots really good enough to dethrone Google? Should I start investing more effort in LLM optimization?

There are basically a thousand products claiming to be AI search engines, but I focused on the biggest and most popular.

I tested out the AI features on offer from two existing search giants—Google’s AI Overviews and Bing AI—and two trendy AI upstarts—ChatGPT Search and Perplexity.

The best AI search engines are—in my opinion—ChatGPT Search for the best chatbot experience, and Google’s AI Overviews for the best all-around search engine.

Read on for pros and cons, screenshots, and short videos of the search experience.

The best AI search engines
AI search engine	Best for…	Pricing
ChatGPT Search	Best AI chatbot search experience	Free; $20/month for Pro
Google AI Overviews	Best combination of traditional search and AI features	Free
Perplexity	Best for research and news	Free; $20/month for Pro
Bing AI	Best for simple searches	Free
My testing process

In order to properly judge the quality of each search engine’s results, I focused on a topic where I’m a world-class expert: digital marketing the role-playing video game Skyrim.

Because I’m an SEO, I also wanted to test as many different types of search queries as possible. I brainstormed tons of Skyrim searches grouped by different categories, including:

Short-tail queries (e.g. skyrim)
Long-tail queries (e.g. how to solve the mzulft oculory puzzle)
Transactional queries (e.g. best paid skyrim mods)
Informational queries (e.g. how to level up smithing quickly in skyrim)
Navigational queries (e.g. uesp skyrim map)
Local queries (e.g. buy skyrim near me)
Image queries (e.g. skyrim landscapes)
Trending queries (e.g. skyrim nolvus)
HOW TO FIND TONS OF KEYWORDS ON ANY TOPIC

The Intents filter in Keywords Explorer was a big help for brainstorming keywords. I ran a search for “skyrim”, navigated to the Matching terms report, and filtered by different intents to find ideas.

I ran these searches through every AI search engine and recorded my experience. I focused particularly on:

Relevance: were the results appropriate for my query?
Accuracy: did the search engines return valid, up-to-date information?
Usefulness: did I meet the intent of my search? Did I leave happy?
Speed: how quickly did I get my answer?
Ease-of-use: how much effort did it require?

This is a completely unscientific but very interesting analysis of the best AI search engines. Let’s get started.

1. Perplexity

 

My opinion: A research assistant that excels with news and summarization, but doesn’t really “feel” like a search engine.

Price: Free; $20/month for Pro

Link: https://www.perplexity.ai/

Pros

Excellent at summarising lots of sources.
Great for news-related topics.
The “Related topics” feature is useful.

Cons

Plenty of incorrect answers and hallucinations.
Bad at image, commercial, and local searches.
Didn’t really feel like a search engine.

Perplexity feels more like a Wiki or a knowledge base than it does a search engine. Many of its responses are terse bulleted lists, and it excelled in summarising technical queries (like DA09Dawnbreaker) or news-related topics (like elder scrolls vi news).

I also noticed lots of errors and hallucinations in its output. One example: for Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim?, Perplexity suggested that werewolves were immune to silver weapons—they actually take bonus damage from them. (C’mon Perplexity, honestly.)

Information often seemed outdated too. Perplexity said that Skyrim SE was on sale for $7.99 on Steam (it wasn’t), and the sale extended until May 30… 2024. It feels like Perplexity’s index isn’t anywhere near as fresh as other AI search engines.

Perplexity also regularly failed to “get” the intent behind my searches, and defaulted to word salad paragraphs of text. When I searched for “Steam skyrim”, I got a long, rambling response with no actual link to Steam. For “Skyrim creations”, it listed no actual creations, and just shared a Wiki-style overview of the Creation concept.

Perplexity also struggled with image searches, commercial queries were very unsatisfying, and local searches were decidedly not local, with responses that recommended websites and shops that were nowhere near me.

2. Google AI Overviews

My opinion: A great all-rounder search engine that incorporates AI in limited—but useful—ways.

Price: Free

Link: https://www.google.com/

Pros

AI Overviews were generally helpful (when they showed up).
Does a great job at surfacing different media formats, like images and videos.
Excels at commercial and transactional searches.

Cons

Very cluttered search results, often with duplication between AI Overviews and Fatured Snippets.
AI Overviews feel like a dead-end—you can’t continue to interact with them.
Felt a little weird having Reddit in the majority of SERPs.

It was fun evaluating Google Search through fresh eyes. Unsurprisingly, Google was very good for commercial and local queries: interactive product carousels made it easy to find relevant products in no time, and map packs were fantastic for finding local shops.

I was also reminded of just how powerful Google’s integration with YouTube is: any queries that were best resolved with video content almost always included YouTube videos—often timestamped—in the SERP.

AI and machine learning underpin all of Google Search, but as far as specific AI features, AI Overviews only triggered for about 15% of my queries. These were all informational queries, and in most cases, they were very specific long-tail queries.

The AI Overviews were actually pretty good, relevant and accurate—but I definitely missed the ability to keep interacting with the AI.

AI Overviews generally felt like amped-up Feature snippets, providing direct, certain answers to long-tail queries in SERPs (and in fact, many of the AI Overviews competed directly with duplicate Featured snippets directly below them in the SERP).

It was also a little weird having Reddit present in so many SERPs. Some queries really are best-suited by user generated content—like those with no objective “best” answer—but Reddit muscled its way in everywhere.

3. ChatGPT Search

 

My opinion: The best AI chatbot for specific, text-heavy searches (but still lacking some “classic” search features).

Price: Free; $20/month for Pro

Link: https://chatgpt.com/

Pros

Excellent for very specific long-tail queries.
The ability to ask follow-on questions is extremely good.
“Memory” feature is useful.

Cons

Outright failed on several occasions.
Pretty bad for image searches and commercial searches.
Verbose, likes to write long answers even for simple questions.

ChatGPT Search is fantastic for very specific long-tail queries. Answers to queries like Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim? were like reading a short blog post that was written just to summarise a bunch of sources specifically for your query—because, well, it was.

Couple this with the ability to ask follow-up questions, and ChatGPT’s ability to remember information from previous conversations (its “memory”), and asking long, complicated questions is a ton of fun.

But this strength is also a weakness. ChatGPT excels with text-heavy queries, and kinda sucks for many others. Short-tail queries felt way more limited than Google. Navigational queries (like skyrim creation kit download) were unsatisfying: ChatGPT would explain precisely how to download the Creation Kit (a modding engine for Skyrim), but it couldn’t actually let you do it.

It was also pretty weak with commercial queries, and very bad at image queries, with a default response limited to just four images (nowhere near enough to sate my appetite for hi-res skyrim landscapes). Although one surprise: ChatGPT Search incorporated playable YouTube videos directly into its responses.

ChatGPT Search outright failed for a few queries, requiring multiple refreshes to get results for very basic queries. All-in-all, it was strongest for queries that benefited from long, detailed text responses, and worse on almost every level for all the other queries.

4. Bing AI

 

My opinion: A solid second-choice search engine with experimental AI features that don’t really deliver.

Price: Free

Link: https://www.bing.com/

Pros

Great at navigational and commercial searches.
Interesting search features for short-tail queries.

Cons

AI features were quite often broken and unhelpful.
Slightly disappointing local and news searches.

Bing has two outwardly obvious “AI” features. One is a text snippet, very similar to Google’s Featured Snippets and AI Overviews. These worked okay, but not as well as Google’s AI Overviews.

Often, the AI answers didn’t quite understand my search (the response for Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim? didn’t actually include an answer—just steps to become either a vampire or werewolf).

The other was a dynamically generated “table of contents” module, and despite looking nice, it generally fell somewhere between not helpful and totally broken, with the different modules appearing in jumbled orders or missing steps.

Like Google Search, Bing performed perfectly at navigational queries and showed tons of products and inspiration for commercial searches. It returned good results for newer, trending topics (as did all the search engines, surprisingly).

Most of all, I loved the visual sidebar that appeared for the short-tail searches, offering tons of facts and trivia for skyrim. When the search intent is so so vague, it seems incredibly helpful to treat the SERP as a mood board of inspiration and possible wormholes to pursue.

Surprisingly, I was disappointed with local searches, and the news search (Elder scrolls vi news) was pretty awful.

Final thoughts

“Traditional” search engines have decades of experience in making searchers—and all the different types of searches they make—happy. This experience is obvious across commercial, local, and image searches where Google and Bing dominated the newer tools.

But “pure” AI search engines also unlock new types of search behavior. The query Skyrim bosmer stealth archer build backstory was sensational with ChatGPT, allowing me to actively brainstorm and refine a story in a way I never could with Google Search. Perplexity excelled at summarising news and complex information.

Are the strengths of AI search engines enough to make up for their many weaknesses? Will searchers abandon a company that controls 88.5% of the current search engine market to experiment with relatively unproven new tools?

More likely (in my estimation) is that we’ll see the existing search engines build, integrate, and partner with AI companies to bring the best features into the existing search experience (like Bing’s partnership with OpenAI.)

In the meantime, the best AI search engines are—in my opinion—ChatGPT Search for the best chatbot experience, and Google’s AI Overviews for the best all-around search engine.

Breaking Down the AI App Development Cost: What You Need to Know in 2025

With the advent of technologies such as Generative Artificial Intelligence, Hyperautomation, ML, or AI, the internet has seen a paradigm shift. The way we consume information or search for it is also constantly evolving. Forget about the days when you would type in keywords to get the search results. The time has come developments in AI have made it possible to produce more relevant results that are adjusted in real-time based on factors such as browsing history, the intent commonly associated with the words used and high-performing content from similar searches. In simpler terms, AI in search engines means rather than having to navigate through a sea of URLs, users will be able to just get the relevant answer combed from the entire internet.

Google, at the forefront of this evolution, has introduced “Circle to Search” and “AI-powered Multi-search,” intending to transform how we search, making the internet feel a bit smaller, natural, and friendlier. So, what does this mean for businesses or users in general? How they can integrate AI into their software to offer users more intuitive, accurate, and valuable information faster for an enhanced browsing experience? Let’s understand how the rise of AI in search engines is changing the way we absorb information or interact with search technology.

From Keywords to Conversations: The Evolution of AI in Search Engines

What roles do AI play in search engines? A question we never thought we’d look forward to. But with the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), search engines have become more than a source of information. AI has empowered search engines to drive innovation in AI and competition. Search engines now can understand natural language queries, rank web pages based on relevance and quality, personalize results for each user and provide rich and interactive features such as voice search, image search, and knowledge graphs. AI also helps search engines combat spam, fraud, and misinformation, and improve user experience and satisfaction.

The Rise of AI in Search Technology: A Look at AI’s Impact on Search Engines

What is AI-powered Multi-search? Recently Google launched two new search features, the first being the “circle to search” and the second being the “AI-powered multi-search” experience, seemingly an upgrade to Google Lens.

According to Google, Circle to Search is “ a new way to search anything on your Android phone without switching apps. Now, with a simple gesture, you can select what you’re curious about in whatever way comes naturally to you — like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping — and get more information right where you are.”

Multi-Search is not a new feature and was introduced in 2022 for images. However, Google has upgraded it so that users can now search with an image and text, simultaneously using their mobile phones. All users need to do is take a photo with their camera upload a photo from their library or upload a screenshot. Next, a user can ask a question using the Google app for iOS or Android, the new AI-powered multi-search experience will show results “with AI-powered insights that go beyond just visual matches.” Thus, giving users the ability to ask more complex or nuanced questions about what they see, and quickly find and understand key information.

Know the Difference: Artificial Intelligence Vs Intelligent Automation

7 Ways How AI-Powered Search Is Empowering Users with Diverse Needs

We now know what AI-powered search engines are capable of, so let’s move on to how artificial technology is revamping the way we find information on the internet.

Personalized Search Results: Users can tailor search results to their specific needs by combining personal images with relevant keywords. This can be helpful for tasks like finding similar home decor styles, identifying skin concerns, or even getting personalized recipe recommendations based on the ingredients you have on hand.
Visual Identification: One can easily identify objects, landmarks, or even products with greater accuracy by combining image search with descriptive text queries. It is quite helpful for finding plants, clothing, furniture, or anything a user might encounter in his daily life.
Enhanced Shopping Experience: Experience advanced product searches with the integration of AI in retail. Refine your product searches by combining images with specific details like color, brand, or style. Imagine finding a dress you love online but only having a picture. Upload the image and add keywords like “long blue dress” to find similar options or the exact product from different retailers.
Breaking Language Barriers: Overcome language barriers by searching for information using both images and text in different languages. This can be incredibly useful while traveling or researching topics in foreign languages.
Multi-dimensional Learning: Gain a deeper understanding of complex concepts by combining visual elements with textual explanations. Students can use multi-search to visualize scientific concepts, historical events, or even art movements, enriching their learning experience.
Fueling Creativity: Spark inspiration and unlock new ideas by using multi-search to explore visual concepts and their corresponding textual information. This can be beneficial for artists, designers, or anyone looking for creative prompts or references.
Accessibility for All: Multi-search empowers users with visual impairments or language disabilities by providing an alternative way to access information. Users can search using images and receive relevant text descriptions or vice versa, making information more accessible to a wider audience.
AI in Search Engine: Looking Ahead

Artificial Intelligence in Search Engines with “Circle to Search,” or “AI-powered multi-search” is still in its early stages, but it holds immense potential to revolutionize the way we interact with information. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated features and applications that cater to an even wider range of user needs.

However, there are certain challenges that the technology needs to overcome. The primary concerns are privacy related to how user data is handled and protected. Ensuring fairness in search results and avoiding reinforcing existing biases remains a challenge, requiring continuous refinement of algorithms. Not just Google but Search Engine providers must navigate these hurdles to provide value without compromising users’ privacy or trust.

Wrapping Up

AI-powered search engines are here to let you make the most of the Internet with searching for information on the go to become more easy thanks to advanced technologies. The internet is all about exploration, and Google with these new AI-powered insights for multi-search at the forefront is bringing unimaginable changes to express what one is looking for, and that too, in the most natural way. AI agents play a crucial role in enhancing these interactions, making searches more contextual and personalized. Thus, as technology advances, how we interact will also transform. Google’s AI-powered Multi-Search and Circle to Search are just the tip of the iceberg. We can expect to witness more such wonders as more and more organizations embrace the idea of a more intuitive, intelligent, personalized, and user-friendly search experience. However, responsible AI usage must be at the core to ensure a positive and responsible impact on users and society.

In the backend layer, responsible for orchestrating user requests, the AI layer introduces techniques like semantic routing, which allocates user requests based on the meaning and intent of the tasks, leveraging LLMs.

As the AI layer becomes more effective, it also reduces the roles and responsibilities of the application and data layers, potentially blurring the boundaries between them. Nevertheless, the AI stack is becoming a cornerstone of software development.

Components of the AI Stack in the Generative AI Landscape:

Programming Language: The language used to develop the components of the stack.
Model Provider: Organizations offering access to foundational models, often more critical than the specific models themselves due to their reputation and reliability.
LLM Orchestrator and Framework: Libraries that simplify the integration of AI application components, including tools for prompt creation and LLM conditioning.
Vector Database: Solutions for storing and managing vector embeddings, crucial for efficient searches.
Operational Database: Data storage solutions for transactional and operational data.
Monitoring and Evaluation Tools: Tools that track AI model performance and reliability, providing analytics and alerts.
Deployment Solution: Services that facilitate the deployment of AI models, including scaling and integration with existing infrastructure.

The emphasis on model providers over specific models highlights the importance of a provider’s ability to update models, offer support, and engage with the community, making switching models as simple as changing a name in the code.

Programming Languages

Programming languages are crucial in shaping the AI stack, influencing the selection of other components and ultimately determining the development of AI applications. The choice of a programming language is especially important for modern AI applications, where security, latency, and maintainability are critical factors.

Among the options for AI application development, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) are the primary choices. Python holds a significant market share among data scientists, machine learning, and AI engineers, largely due to its extensive library support, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. Python’s readable syntax and flexibility, accommodating both simple scripts and full applications with an object-oriented approach, contribute to its popularity.

According to the February 2024 update on the PYPL (PopularitY of Programming Language) Index, Python leads with a 28.11% share, reflecting a growth trend of +0.6% over the previous year. The PYPL Index tracks the popularity of programming languages based on the frequency of tutorial searches on Google, indicating broader usage and interest.

JavaScript, with an 8.57% share in the PYPL Index, has traditionally dominated web application development and is now increasingly used in the AI domain. This is facilitated by libraries and frameworks that integrate AI functionalities into web environments, enabling web developers to leverage AI infrastructure directly. Notable AI frameworks like LlamaIndex and LangChain offer implementations in both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.

The GitHub 2023 State of Open Source report highlights JavaScript’s dominance among developers, with Python showing a 22.5% year-over-year increase in usage on the platform. This growth reflects Python’s versatility in applications ranging from web development to data-driven systems and machine learning.

The programming language component of the AI stack is more established and predictable compared to other components, with Python and JavaScript/TypeScript solidifying their positions among software engineers, web developers, data scientists, and AI engineers.

Model Providers

Model providers are a pivotal component of the AI stack, offering access to powerful large language models (LLMs) and other AI models. These providers, ranging from small organizations to large corporations, make available various types of models, including embedding models, fine-tuned models, and foundational models, for integration into generative AI applications.

The AI landscape features a wide array of models that support capabilities like predictive analytics, image generation, and text completion. These models can be broadly classified into closed-source and open-source categories.

Closed-Source Models have privatized internal configurations, architectures, and algorithms, which are not shared with the model consumers. Key information about the training processes and data is withheld, limiting the extent to which users can modify the model’s behavior. Access to these models is typically provided through an API or a web interface. Examples of closed-source models include:

Claude by Anthropic, available via web chat interface and API.
OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as embedding models like text-embedding-ada-002, accessible through APIs and chat interfaces.

Open-Source Models offer a different approach, with varying levels of openness regarding their internal architecture, training data, weights, and parameters. These models foster collaboration and transparency in the AI community. The levels of open-source models include:

Fully Open Source: All aspects, including weights, architecture, and training data, are publicly accessible without restrictions.
Open Weight: Only the model weights and parameters are available for public use.
Open Model: Model weights and parameters are available under certain terms of use specified by the creators.

Open-source models democratize access to advanced AI technology, reducing the entry barriers for developers to experiment with niche use cases. Examples of open-source models include:

LLaMA by Meta, a family of text generation models with varying parameter counts.
Mixtral-8×7 by Mistral AI.
Gemma by Google.
Grok by X (formerly Twitter).
Open-Source vs. Closed-Source Large Language Models (LLMs)

AI engineers and machine learning practitioners often face the critical decision of whether to use open- or closed-source LLMs in their AI stacks. This choice significantly impacts the development process, scalability, ethical considerations, and the application’s utility and commercial flexibility.

Key Considerations for Selecting LLMs and Their Providers

Resource Availability

The decision between open- and closed-source models often hinges on the availability of compute resources and team expertise. Closed-source model providers simplify the development, training, and management of LLMs, albeit at the cost of potentially using consumer data for training or relinquishing control of private data access. Utilizing closed-source models allows teams to focus on other aspects of the stack, such as user interface design and data integrity. In contrast, open-source models offer more control and privacy but require significant resources to fine-tune, maintain, and deploy.

Project Requirements

The scale and technical requirements of a project are crucial in deciding whether to use open- or closed-source LLMs. Large-scale projects, particularly those needing robust technical support and service guarantees, may benefit from closed-source models. However, this reliance comes with the risk of being affected by the provider’s API uptime and availability. Smaller projects or those in the proof-of-concept phase might find open-source LLMs more suitable due to their flexibility and lower cost.

Privacy Requirements

Privacy concerns are paramount, especially regarding sharing sensitive data with closed-source providers. In the era of generative AI, proprietary data is a valuable asset, and some large data repositories are now requiring model providers to agree to AI data licensing contracts. The choice between open- and closed-source models involves balancing access to cutting-edge technology with maintaining data privacy and security.

Other factors to consider include ethical and transparency needs, prediction accuracy, maintenance costs, and overall infrastructure expenses. Performance benchmarks like the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) highlight that open-source models are rapidly approaching the performance levels of closed-source models. This trend suggests that the choice between open and closed models may soon become secondary to other evaluative criteria.

Performance and Adoption Trends

The ease of integration often drives the adoption of closed-source models, as they typically require less engineering effort for deployment, being accessible via APIs. However, companies like Hugging Face and Ollama are making it easier to deploy open-source models, offering solutions that reduce the complexity traditionally associated with these models. This accessibility could lead to increased adoption of open-source models, especially as businesses prioritize transparency, data control, and cost-effectiveness.

Even major companies are embracing open-source models. For instance, Google has categorized some of its offerings as “open models,” which require agreement to certain terms of use despite being publicly available. This trend indicates a growing recognition of the value of open-source models in the AI ecosystem.

LLM Frameworks and Orchestrators

LLM frameworks and orchestrators, such as LlamaIndex, LangChain, Haystack, and DSPy, play a crucial role in the AI stack by bridging various components. These tools abstract the complexities involved in developing LLM-powered AI applications, including:

Connecting vector databases with LLMs
Implementing prompt engineering techniques
Integrating multiple data sources with vector databases
Managing data indexing, chunking, and ingestion processes

These frameworks reduce the amount of code developers need to write, allowing teams to focus on core features and accelerating the development process. However, they are not without challenges, particularly regarding stability, maturity, and frequent updates, which can lead to compatibility issues.

LLM frameworks are essential tools that facilitate the integration of other AI stack components. However, the widespread adoption of these tools can also influence the choice of other components within the stack, potentially leading to standardization or fragmentation based on the frameworks used.

The discussion around LLM frameworks reflects broader trends in the tech stack world, where differing philosophies and approaches can lead to divisions, similar to those seen between Angular and React in web development or TensorFlow and PyTorch in machine learning. This division could also emerge in the AI stack as the field continues to evolve and mature.

DSPy and LangChain: Opinionated LLM Frameworks

DSPy: Systematic LLM Optimization

DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Language Programs, pythonically) is an LLM framework that emphasizes a programmatic and systematic approach to utilizing and tuning LLMs within AI applications. Unlike traditional methods that heavily rely on prompt engineering, DSPy modularizes the entire pipeline. It integrates prompting, fine-tuning, and other components into an optimizer that can be systematically tuned and used as objective metrics to optimize the entire process.

Example: RAG Module Using DSPy

python

Copy code

class RAG(dspy.Module):

def __init__(self, num_passages=3):

super().__init__()

self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)

self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)

def forward(self, question):

context = self.retrieve(question).passages

prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)

return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)

LangChain: Modular LLM Application Development

LangChain is another widely used LLM framework that employs a declarative implementation, known as LangChain Expressive Language (LCEL), aimed at building production-ready AI applications. LCEL supports modularity and reusability through chain composition, allowing components of the pipeline to be configured with clear interfaces, enabling parallelization and dynamic configuration.

Example: RAG Module Using LangChain

python

Copy code

# Defining the chat prompt

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# Defining the model for chat completion

model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Parse output as a string

parse_output = StrOutputParser()

# Naive RAG chain

naive_rag_chain = (

retrieve

| prompt

| model

| parse_output

)

Vector and Operational Databases

Vector Databases: Efficient Handling of Complex Data

Modern AI applications increasingly require vector databases due to the growing complexity of data types like images, large text corpora, and audio. Vector embeddings, which are high-dimensional numerical representations of data, are used to capture the context and semantics of raw data. These embeddings facilitate tasks like recommendation systems, chatbots, and Retrieve-And-Generate (RAG) applications by enabling context-based searches.

Vector databases specialize in storing, indexing, managing, and retrieving vector embeddings, optimizing for operations on high-dimensional vectors using algorithms like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World). The integration of vector databases with other AI stack components is crucial for maintaining seamless data flow and system efficiency.

Operational Databases: Managing Data Complexity

Operational databases are essential for managing transactional, metadata, and user-specific data within AI applications. They provide high throughput, efficient transactional data operations, scalability, and data workflow management capabilities. Combining vector and operational databases can streamline data management, eliminating silos and enhancing system efficiency.

MongoDB: A Dual Role in AI Stacks

MongoDB serves as both a vector and operational database, supporting complex data storage needs, real-time processing, and vector search capabilities. Its infrastructure, including Atlas Search and Vector Search, provides a unified platform for managing diverse data types and applications.
