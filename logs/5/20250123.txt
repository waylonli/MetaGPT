Summary
My testing process
1. Perplexity
2. Google AI Overviews
3. ChatGPT Search
4. Bing AI
I rigorously tested the most popular AI search engines to discover their strengths and weaknesses.

 

I ran this test for two reasons:

As a human being, I want to use the best search engine around. I spend my life on the internet. I want to find information in the fastest, most effortless way possible.
As a marketer, I want to know where the tide is headed. Will AI search engines replace “traditional” search engines? Are AI chatbots really good enough to dethrone Google? Should I start investing more effort in LLM optimization?

There are basically a thousand products claiming to be AI search engines, but I focused on the biggest and most popular.

I tested out the AI features on offer from two existing search giants—Google’s AI Overviews and Bing AI—and two trendy AI upstarts—ChatGPT Search and Perplexity.

The best AI search engines are—in my opinion—ChatGPT Search for the best chatbot experience, and Google’s AI Overviews for the best all-around search engine.

Read on for pros and cons, screenshots, and short videos of the search experience.

The best AI search engines
AI search engine	Best for…	Pricing
ChatGPT Search	Best AI chatbot search experience	Free; $20/month for Pro
Google AI Overviews	Best combination of traditional search and AI features	Free
Perplexity	Best for research and news	Free; $20/month for Pro
Bing AI	Best for simple searches	Free
My testing process

In order to properly judge the quality of each search engine’s results, I focused on a topic where I’m a world-class expert: digital marketing the role-playing video game Skyrim.

Because I’m an SEO, I also wanted to test as many different types of search queries as possible. I brainstormed tons of Skyrim searches grouped by different categories, including:

Short-tail queries (e.g. skyrim)
Long-tail queries (e.g. how to solve the mzulft oculory puzzle)
Transactional queries (e.g. best paid skyrim mods)
Informational queries (e.g. how to level up smithing quickly in skyrim)
Navigational queries (e.g. uesp skyrim map)
Local queries (e.g. buy skyrim near me)
Image queries (e.g. skyrim landscapes)
Trending queries (e.g. skyrim nolvus)
HOW TO FIND TONS OF KEYWORDS ON ANY TOPIC

The Intents filter in Keywords Explorer was a big help for brainstorming keywords. I ran a search for “skyrim”, navigated to the Matching terms report, and filtered by different intents to find ideas.

I ran these searches through every AI search engine and recorded my experience. I focused particularly on:

Relevance: were the results appropriate for my query?
Accuracy: did the search engines return valid, up-to-date information?
Usefulness: did I meet the intent of my search? Did I leave happy?
Speed: how quickly did I get my answer?
Ease-of-use: how much effort did it require?

This is a completely unscientific but very interesting analysis of the best AI search engines. Let’s get started.

1. Perplexity

 

My opinion: A research assistant that excels with news and summarization, but doesn’t really “feel” like a search engine.

Price: Free; $20/month for Pro

Link: https://www.perplexity.ai/

Pros

Excellent at summarising lots of sources.
Great for news-related topics.
The “Related topics” feature is useful.

Cons

Plenty of incorrect answers and hallucinations.
Bad at image, commercial, and local searches.
Didn’t really feel like a search engine.

Perplexity feels more like a Wiki or a knowledge base than it does a search engine. Many of its responses are terse bulleted lists, and it excelled in summarising technical queries (like DA09Dawnbreaker) or news-related topics (like elder scrolls vi news).

I also noticed lots of errors and hallucinations in its output. One example: for Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim?, Perplexity suggested that werewolves were immune to silver weapons—they actually take bonus damage from them. (C’mon Perplexity, honestly.)

Information often seemed outdated too. Perplexity said that Skyrim SE was on sale for $7.99 on Steam (it wasn’t), and the sale extended until May 30… 2024. It feels like Perplexity’s index isn’t anywhere near as fresh as other AI search engines.

Perplexity also regularly failed to “get” the intent behind my searches, and defaulted to word salad paragraphs of text. When I searched for “Steam skyrim”, I got a long, rambling response with no actual link to Steam. For “Skyrim creations”, it listed no actual creations, and just shared a Wiki-style overview of the Creation concept.

Perplexity also struggled with image searches, commercial queries were very unsatisfying, and local searches were decidedly not local, with responses that recommended websites and shops that were nowhere near me.

2. Google AI Overviews

My opinion: A great all-rounder search engine that incorporates AI in limited—but useful—ways.

Price: Free

Link: https://www.google.com/

Pros

AI Overviews were generally helpful (when they showed up).
Does a great job at surfacing different media formats, like images and videos.
Excels at commercial and transactional searches.

Cons

Very cluttered search results, often with duplication between AI Overviews and Fatured Snippets.
AI Overviews feel like a dead-end—you can’t continue to interact with them.
Felt a little weird having Reddit in the majority of SERPs.

It was fun evaluating Google Search through fresh eyes. Unsurprisingly, Google was very good for commercial and local queries: interactive product carousels made it easy to find relevant products in no time, and map packs were fantastic for finding local shops.

I was also reminded of just how powerful Google’s integration with YouTube is: any queries that were best resolved with video content almost always included YouTube videos—often timestamped—in the SERP.

AI and machine learning underpin all of Google Search, but as far as specific AI features, AI Overviews only triggered for about 15% of my queries. These were all informational queries, and in most cases, they were very specific long-tail queries.

The AI Overviews were actually pretty good, relevant and accurate—but I definitely missed the ability to keep interacting with the AI.

AI Overviews generally felt like amped-up Feature snippets, providing direct, certain answers to long-tail queries in SERPs (and in fact, many of the AI Overviews competed directly with duplicate Featured snippets directly below them in the SERP).

It was also a little weird having Reddit present in so many SERPs. Some queries really are best-suited by user generated content—like those with no objective “best” answer—but Reddit muscled its way in everywhere.

3. ChatGPT Search

 

My opinion: The best AI chatbot for specific, text-heavy searches (but still lacking some “classic” search features).

Price: Free; $20/month for Pro

Link: https://chatgpt.com/

Pros

Excellent for very specific long-tail queries.
The ability to ask follow-on questions is extremely good.
“Memory” feature is useful.

Cons

Outright failed on several occasions.
Pretty bad for image searches and commercial searches.
Verbose, likes to write long answers even for simple questions.

ChatGPT Search is fantastic for very specific long-tail queries. Answers to queries like Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim? were like reading a short blog post that was written just to summarise a bunch of sources specifically for your query—because, well, it was.

Couple this with the ability to ask follow-up questions, and ChatGPT’s ability to remember information from previous conversations (its “memory”), and asking long, complicated questions is a ton of fun.

But this strength is also a weakness. ChatGPT excels with text-heavy queries, and kinda sucks for many others. Short-tail queries felt way more limited than Google. Navigational queries (like skyrim creation kit download) were unsatisfying: ChatGPT would explain precisely how to download the Creation Kit (a modding engine for Skyrim), but it couldn’t actually let you do it.

It was also pretty weak with commercial queries, and very bad at image queries, with a default response limited to just four images (nowhere near enough to sate my appetite for hi-res skyrim landscapes). Although one surprise: ChatGPT Search incorporated playable YouTube videos directly into its responses.

ChatGPT Search outright failed for a few queries, requiring multiple refreshes to get results for very basic queries. All-in-all, it was strongest for queries that benefited from long, detailed text responses, and worse on almost every level for all the other queries.

4. Bing AI

 

My opinion: A solid second-choice search engine with experimental AI features that don’t really deliver.

Price: Free

Link: https://www.bing.com/

Pros

Great at navigational and commercial searches.
Interesting search features for short-tail queries.

Cons

AI features were quite often broken and unhelpful.
Slightly disappointing local and news searches.

Bing has two outwardly obvious “AI” features. One is a text snippet, very similar to Google’s Featured Snippets and AI Overviews. These worked okay, but not as well as Google’s AI Overviews.

Often, the AI answers didn’t quite understand my search (the response for Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim? didn’t actually include an answer—just steps to become either a vampire or werewolf).

The other was a dynamically generated “table of contents” module, and despite looking nice, it generally fell somewhere between not helpful and totally broken, with the different modules appearing in jumbled orders or missing steps.

Like Google Search, Bing performed perfectly at navigational queries and showed tons of products and inspiration for commercial searches. It returned good results for newer, trending topics (as did all the search engines, surprisingly).

Most of all, I loved the visual sidebar that appeared for the short-tail searches, offering tons of facts and trivia for skyrim. When the search intent is so so vague, it seems incredibly helpful to treat the SERP as a mood board of inspiration and possible wormholes to pursue.

Surprisingly, I was disappointed with local searches, and the news search (Elder scrolls vi news) was pretty awful.

Final thoughts

“Traditional” search engines have decades of experience in making searchers—and all the different types of searches they make—happy. This experience is obvious across commercial, local, and image searches where Google and Bing dominated the newer tools.

But “pure” AI search engines also unlock new types of search behavior. The query Skyrim bosmer stealth archer build backstory was sensational with ChatGPT, allowing me to actively brainstorm and refine a story in a way I never could with Google Search. Perplexity excelled at summarising news and complex information.

Are the strengths of AI search engines enough to make up for their many weaknesses? Will searchers abandon a company that controls 88.5% of the current search engine market to experiment with relatively unproven new tools?

More likely (in my estimation) is that we’ll see the existing search engines build, integrate, and partner with AI companies to bring the best features into the existing search experience (like Bing’s partnership with OpenAI.)

In the meantime, the best AI search engines are—in my opinion—ChatGPT Search for the best chatbot experience, and Google’s AI Overviews for the best all-around search engine.

I ran a search for “skyrim”, navigated to the Matching terms report, and filtered by different intents to find\xa0ideas.\n\nI ran these searches through every AI search engine and recorded my experience. I focused particularly on:\n\nRelevance: were the results appropriate for my\xa0query?\nAccuracy: did the search engines return valid, up-to-date information?\nUsefulness: did I meet the intent of my search? Did I leave\xa0happy?\nSpeed: how quickly did I get my answer?\nEase-of-use: how much effort did it require?\n\nThis is a completely unscientific but very interesting analysis of the best AI search engines. Let’s get started.\n\n1. Perplexity\n\n\xa0\n\nMy opinion: A research assistant that excels with news and summarization, but doesn’t really “feel” like a search engine.\n\nPrice: Free; $20/month for\xa0Pro\n\nLink: https://www.perplexity.ai/\n\nPros\n\nExcellent at summarising lots of sources.\nGreat for news-related topics.\nThe “Related topics” feature is useful.\n\nCons\n\nPlenty of incorrect answers and hallucinations.\nBad at image, commercial, and local searches.\nDidn’t really feel like a search engine.\n\nPerplexity feels more like a Wiki or a knowledge base than it does a search engine. Many of its responses are terse bulleted lists, and it excelled in summarising technical queries (like DA09Dawnbreaker) or news-related topics (like elder scrolls vi news).\n\nI also noticed lots of errors and hallucinations in its output. One example: for Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim?, Perplexity suggested that werewolves were immune to silver weapons—they actually take bonus damage from them. (C’mon Perplexity, honestly.)\n\nInformation often seemed outdated too. Perplexity said that Skyrim SE was on sale for $7.99 on Steam (it wasn’t), and the sale extended until May 30… 2024. It feels like Perplexity’s index isn’t anywhere near as fresh as other AI search engines.\n\nPerplexity also regularly failed to “get” the intent behind my searches, and defaulted to word salad paragraphs of text. When I searched for “Steam skyrim”, I got a long, rambling response with no actual link to Steam. For “Skyrim creations”, it listed no actual creations, and just shared a Wiki-style overview of the Creation concept.\n\nPerplexity also struggled with image searches, commercial queries were very unsatisfying, and local searches were decidedly not local, with responses that recommended websites and shops that were nowhere near\xa0me.\n\n2. Google AI Overviews\n\nMy opinion: A great all-rounder search engine that incorporates AI in limited—but useful—ways.\n\nPrice: Free\n\nLink:\xa0https://www.google.com/\n\nPros\n\nAI Overviews were generally helpful (when they showed up).\nDoes a great job at surfacing different media formats, like images and videos.\nExcels at commercial and transactional searches.\n\nCons\n\nVery cluttered search results, often with duplication between AI Overviews and Fatured Snippets.\nAI Overviews feel like a dead-end—you can’t continue to interact with\xa0them.\nFelt a little weird having Reddit in the majority of\xa0SERPs.\n\nIt was fun evaluating Google Search through fresh eyes. Unsurprisingly, Google was very good for commercial and local queries: interactive product carousels made it easy to find relevant products in no time, and map packs were fantastic for finding local\xa0shops.\n\nI was also reminded of just how powerful Google’s integration with YouTube is: any queries that were best resolved with video content almost always included YouTube videos—often timestamped—in the\xa0SERP.\n\nAI and machine learning underpin all of Google Search, but as far as specific AI features, AI Overviews only triggered for about 15% of my queries. These were all informational queries, and in most cases, they were very specific long-tail queries.\n\nThe AI Overviews were actually pretty good, relevant and accurate—but I definitely missed the ability to keep interacting with the\xa0AI.\n\nAI Overviews generally felt like amped-up Feature snippets, providing direct, certain answers to long-tail queries in SERPs (and in fact, many of the AI Overviews competed directly with duplicate Featured snippets directly below them in the\xa0SERP).\n\nIt was also a little weird having Reddit present in so many SERPs. Some queries really are best-suited by user generated content—like those with no objective “best” answer—but Reddit muscled its way in everywhere.\n\n3. ChatGPT Search\n\n\xa0\n\nMy opinion: The best AI chatbot for specific, text-heavy searches (but still lacking some “classic” search features).\n\nPrice: Free; $20/month for\xa0Pro\n\nLink: https://chatgpt.com/\n\nPros\n\nExcellent for very specific long-tail queries.\nThe ability to ask follow-on questions is extremely good.\n“Memory” feature is useful.\n\nCons\n\nOutright failed on several occasions.\nPretty bad for image searches and commercial searches.\nVerbose, likes to write long answers even for simple questions.\n\nChatGPT Search is fantastic for very specific long-tail queries. Answers to queries like Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim? were like reading a short blog post that was written just to summarise a bunch of sources specifically for your query—because, well, it\xa0was.\n\nCouple this with the ability to ask follow-up questions, and ChatGPT’s ability to remember information from previous conversations (its “memory”), and asking long, complicated questions is a ton of\xa0fun.\n\nBut this strength is also a weakness. ChatGPT excels with text-heavy queries, and kinda sucks for many others. Short-tail queries felt way more limited than Google. Navigational queries (like skyrim creation kit download) were unsatisfying: ChatGPT would explain precisely how to download the Creation Kit (a modding engine for Skyrim), but it couldn’t actually let you do it.\n\nIt was also pretty weak with commercial queries, and very bad at image queries, with a default response limited to just four images (nowhere near enough to sate my appetite for hi-res skyrim landscapes). Although one surprise: ChatGPT Search incorporated playable YouTube videos directly into its responses.\n\nChatGPT Search outright failed for a few queries, requiring multiple refreshes to get results for very basic queries. All-in-all, it was strongest for queries that benefited from long, detailed text responses, and worse on almost every level for all the other queries.\n\n4. Bing\xa0AI\n\n\xa0\n\nMy opinion: A solid second-choice search engine with experimental AI features that don’t really deliver.\n\nPrice: Free\n\nLink:\xa0https://www.bing.com/\n\nPros\n\nGreat at navigational and commercial searches.\nInteresting search features for short-tail queries.\n\nCons\n\nAI features were quite often broken and unhelpful.\nSlightly disappointing local and news searches.\n\nBing has two outwardly obvious “AI” features. One is a text snippet, very similar to Google’s Featured Snippets and AI Overviews. These worked okay, but not as well as Google’s AI Overviews.\n\nOften, the AI answers didn’t quite understand my search (the response for Should I become a vampire or a werewolf in skyrim? didn’t actually include an answer—just steps to become either a vampire or werewolf).\n\nThe other was a dynamically generated “table of contents” module, and despite looking nice, it generally fell somewhere between not helpful and totally broken, with the different modules appearing in jumbled orders or missing steps.\n\nLike Google Search, Bing performed perfectly at navigational queries and showed tons of products and inspiration for commercial searches. It returned good results for newer, trending topics (as did all the search engines, surprisingly).\n\nMost of all, I loved the visual sidebar that appeared for the short-tail searches, offering tons of facts and trivia for skyrim. When the search intent is so so vague, it seems incredibly helpful to treat the SERP as a mood board of inspiration and possible wormholes to pursue.\n\nSurprisingly, I was disappointed with local searches, and the news search (Elder scrolls vi news) was pretty awful.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n“Traditional” search engines have decades of experience in making searchers—and all the different types of searches they make—happy. This experience is obvious across commercial, local, and image searches where Google and Bing dominated the newer\xa0tools.\n\nBut “pure” AI search engines also unlock new types of search behavior. The query Skyrim bosmer stealth archer build backstory was sensational with ChatGPT, allowing me to actively brainstorm and refine a story in a way I never could with Google Search. Perplexity excelled at summarising news and complex information.\n\nAre the strengths of AI search engines enough to make up for their many weaknesses? Will searchers abandon a company that controls 88.5% of the current search engine market to experiment with relatively unproven new\xa0tools?\n\nMore likely (in my estimation) is that we’ll see the existing search engines build, integrate, and partner with AI companies to bring the best features into the existing search experience (like Bing’s partnership with OpenAI.)\n\nIn the meantime, the best AI search engines are—in my opinion—ChatGPT Search for the best chatbot experience, and Google’s AI Overviews for the best all-around search engine.\n\nArticle by\nRyan Law\nRyan Law is the Director of Content Marketing at Ahrefs.

Google's share of the search ad market could drop below 50% for the first time in a decade as AI search engines boom

Google is facing new competition in the advertising market as AI transforms the industry.
Google's search ad market share in the US could fall below 50% for the first time in a decade.
Perplexity AI, meanwhile, says it is attracting "top-tier" advertisers.

Google is facing a challenge to its decadeslong dominance of the internet's advertising market as AI, the new kid on the block, changes everything.

Projections by eMarketer — a digital marketing research company owned by Business Insider parent company Axel Springer — say that Google's share of the US search advertising market could drop below 50% next year for the first time in more than a decade.

Long dominant, Google has begun to slip in other significant ways too. A recent study found that younger generations, like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are no longer using the word "Google" as a verb. Young internet users are now "searching" instead of "Googling," Mark Shmulik, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said in a note to investors last month.

This shift is due in part to the rise of AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity AI, which use large language models trained on massive amounts of data to answer user questions in natural language. ChatGPT set the record for the fast-growing user base for a consumer application soon after it first launched in late 2022.

Never to be outdone, Google has raced to catch up. It launched Gemini, its own large language model that now presents Google search results in natural language at the top of the page, in March 2023. Google has since rolled out a series of other generative AI tools and enhancements to its search engine.

Google is also leveraging AI to better present ads in its search results. It demonstrated an example earlier this month, showing how Tide products are now advertised below a search query for "how do I get grass stains out of jeans?"

"We're confident in this approach to monetizing our AI-powered experiences," Brendon Kraham, a Google vice president overseeing the search ads business, told The Wall Street Journal. "We've been here before navigating these kinds of changes."

While Google is still the most used search engine by a long shot, its competitors are nipping at its heels. The Perplexity AI search engine says it processed 340 million queries in September and has several "household, top-tier" companies looking to advertise on the platform, chief business officer Dmitry Shevelenko said, according to the Journal.

Perplexity is valued at over $1 billion and has received funding from Jeff Bezos and Nvidia. It has also faced backlash, however, for not sourcing copyrighted material used in its results. Forbes accused the company in June of ripping off its content without attribution after the platform shared details of an investigative article on its new "Perplexity Pages" feature.

On Perplexity, search queries are followed by questions that engage the user in a conversation. Perplexity says it will allow sponsors to advertise on those follow-up questions in the future.

In a presentation to advertisers, Perplexity said answers to the sponsored questions would be approved ahead of time by advertisers "and can be locked, giving you comfort in how your brand will be portrayed in an answer," The Journal reported.

"What we're opening up is the ability for a brand to spark or inspire somebody to ask a question about them," Shevelenko said.

Google and Perplexity AI did not immediately return requests for comment for this story.

GenAI search vs. traditional search engines: How they differ
Search engines are the original way to browse the internet. GenAI search is a new method to explore and get answers to queries. Learn how it compares to traditional searches.
By
Sean Michael Kerner
Published: 11 Dec 2024

In the early days of the internet, it became clear that some form of technology was needed to help users navigate and find information as traffic began to surge. This led to the emergence of the first search engines, which helped users find content on the growing internet.

For most of the history of the internet, search has been predicated on the same basic process: Content is indexed to match keyword queries. With the advent of generative AI, the search landscape began to shift in a meaningful way for the first time in decades. GenAI search enables users to get results that include more and are not limited to keyword relevance. With GenAI search, large language models (LLMs) provide answers instead of only a page of results.

Multiple providers have entered the GenAI search market in recent years. Startups such as Perplexity AI have come into the space with entirely new GenAI search services. OpenAI, the vendor behind ChatGPT, entered the space with its ChatGPT search. Existing search vendors, including Google and Microsoft, have also offered AI options. Google has its AI Overviews technology, and Microsoft Bing has also integrated GenAI augmented search. Meta is also reportedly exploring GenAI search for its social media platforms.

What are GenAI search engines?

GenAI search engines are an evolution of search engine technology.

The primary defining innovation and characteristic of GenAI search engines is the use of LLMs to deliver a different type of experience than a traditional search engine. A GenAI search engine uses the LLM to understand, retrieve and generate responses to user queries. A regular LLM generates answers to user queries based on the knowledge available up to its training cutoff date, limiting its ability to provide information beyond that point.

In contrast, a GenAI search engine has no such knowledge cutoff and can use up-to-date information, similar to a regular search engine, to generate responses. GenAI search engines combine machine learning and natural language processing to understand user queries semantically.

The use of an LLM provides a series of different benefits and capabilities, including the following:

Interprets user intent from natural language queries with more accuracy.
Provides direct answers to queries, instead of only links to resources.
Offers detailed explanations and clarifications.
Combines and integrates information from multiple sources to deliver comprehensive responses.
Engages in follow-up conversations with options for related topics and queries.
How do GenAI searches work?

GenAI searches work similarly to how an LLM normally works but with some notable distinctions -- most significantly, the incorporation of updated information.

The basic procedures involved in GenAI searches include the following:

Query input. The user enters a query in natural language. The system processes the query by performing tasks such as tokenization and key phrase identification.
Intent and understanding. The GenAI search technology not only looks at the user query in terms of the words used, but it also attempts to understand the user's intent for the query. The intent is to understand what the user wants to do with the query. For example, is the intent of the query informational, navigational or transactional?
Information retrieval. The GenAI search system uses its knowledge base data set to answer the user's query. That knowledge base includes the pretrained LLM and updated real-time web crawling.
Response generation. A response is generated that best matches the user query and intent. The generated response is refined for accuracy, relevance and coherence. The AI search engine structures its response in a coherent and readable format. It may include relevant citations or links to source material. Some systems also include expandable sections or follow-up question suggestions.
Feedback and continuous learning. Many GenAI search engines incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve performance over time. That feedback can be implicit or explicit from the user on the quality of the search results.
How do traditional search engines work?

Traditional search engines, such as Google's core search index, operate on a different principle compared to GenAI search engines. Traditional search engines help users find the best answers to their queries by offering links to relevant sources.

The basic process behind how traditional search engines work includes the following:

Crawling. The first stage involves automated web crawlers, or bots, that scan the internet for web content. These crawlers systematically browse the web to discover new and updated pages.
Parsing and analysis. Once a crawler discovers web content, it analyzes the structural elements of the page, such as title tags, meta descriptions, headings and body text. This analysis helps the crawler identify and extract links to other pages.
Indexing. The discovered pages are analyzed and categorized based on their content, keywords and other parsed data.
Ranking. The search engine uses complex algorithms to rank the indexed pages based on the relevance to the query and the quality. One example of a ranking algorithm is Google's PageRank, which has undergone numerous updates and changes over the last two decades.
Search engine results page (SERP). The relevant results of the user query are ranked and presented on a SERP. Each result typically includes a title, URL, and brief description or snippet.
Key differences between GenAI searches vs. traditional search engines

There are numerous key differences between GenAI search and traditional search engine approaches.

Aspect	GenAI search engines	Traditional search engines
Response	Direct, conversational responses	List of links with snippets
Content generation	Can create original content on the fly	Only retrieve existing information
Query understanding	Advanced understanding of natural language and user intent	Primarily keyword-based with some semantic understanding
Contextual awareness	Maintain context throughout a conversation	Has limited context awareness -- each query treated separately
Information synthesis	Can combine information from multiple sources	Present separate results from different sources
Update frequency	Can incorporate recent information	Depend on web crawling and indexing cycles
Personalization	Can tailor responses based on conversation history	Personalize based on user data and search history
AI's impact on SEO

For nearly as long as search engines have existed, individuals and organizations have focused on search engine optimization. SEO attempts to improve a webpage and its content to achieve a higher ranking in search results.

The rise of AI-powered search engines is impacting SEO strategies in significant ways, including the following:

Keywords aren't enough. SEO strategies that are focused solely on keyword optimization may become less effective as search engines provide more conversational and context-aware results. With AI's ability to understand context and intent, the focus shifts even more toward creating high-quality, informative content that directly addresses user needs.
Natural language needs to be optimized. SEO strategies now need to consider natural language patterns and conversational queries.
Driving traffic is more challenging. With traditional search engines, SEO was often seen as a straight line to getting better ranking, leading to clicks and traffic. With GenAI search, that's no longer guaranteed. With summarized answers, simple queries may not lead to clicks or publisher traffic. What's needed is more detailed information than a simple summary can provide. SEO and traffic optimization need to do more to be successful.
The future of search and AI

Traditional search engines have been on the internet for over two decades. Over that time frame, the traditional search engines have iterated many times to keep delivering the best results for users. The path for search and AI will likely be the same with continued evolution and iteration.

As these technologies continue to evolve, the market should expect to see the following:

More personalized results. AI will likely provide increasingly highly customized search experiences based on user preferences and behaviors. That goes beyond the current versions that understand basic context and user intent.
Enhanced multimodal search. Much like LLMs are on a multimodal path, future AI search engines will likely better integrate text, image, voice and video search capabilities.
Improved accuracy. As AI models are refined and training data expands, the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses will likely improve.
Publisher engagement. With traditional AI search engines, publishers typically welcome web crawlers as they help to drive traffic. With GenAI search, where clicks and web traffic are not guaranteed, it becomes increasingly important for publishers and GenAI search technologies to strike content agreements. Perplexity AI is starting to engage with some publishers, though others -- such as The New York Times, which filed a lawsuit against the GenAI search vendor -- are not welcoming collaboration.

RAG 101: Demystifying Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipelines
Dec 18, 2023

 Discuss (1)

Large language models (LLMs) have impressed the world with their unprecedented capabilities to comprehend and generate human-like responses. Their chat functionality provides a fast and natural interaction between humans and large corpora of data. For example, they can summarize and extract highlights from data or replace complex queries such as SQL queries with natural language. 

It is tempting to assume that business value can be generated by these models with no extra effort, but this is unfortunately not often the case. Luckily, all that enterprises must do to extract value out of using LLMs is to augment the LLM with their own data. This can be done with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which is showcased in the NVIDIA Generative AI Examples GitHub repo for developers 

By augmenting an LLM with business data, enterprises can make their AI applications agile and responsive to new developments. For instance:

Chatbots: Many enterprises already use AI chatbots to power basic customer interactions on their websites. With RAG, companies can build a chat experience that’s highly specific to their product. For example, questions about product specifications could easily be answered. 
Customer service: Companies can empower live service representatives to easily answer customer questions with precise, up-to-date information.
Enterprise search: Businesses have a wealth of knowledge across the organization, including technical documentation, company policies, IT support articles, and code repositories. Employees could query an internal search engine to retrieve information faster and more efficiently.

This post explains the benefits of using the RAG technique when building an LLM application, along with the components of a RAG pipeline. For more information after you finish this post, see RAG 101: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Questions Answered.

Benefits of RAG

There are several advantages of using RAG:

Empowering LLM solutions with real-time data access
Preserving data privacy
Mitigating LLM hallucinations
Empowering LLM solutions with real-time data access

Data is constantly changing in an enterprise. AI solutions that use LLMs can remain up-to-date and current with RAG, which facilitates direct access to additional data resources. These resources can consist of real-time and personalized data. 

Preserving data privacy

Ensuring data privacy is crucial for enterprises. With a self-hosted LLM (demonstrated in the RAG workflow), sensitive data can be kept on-premises just like the stored data. 

Mitigating LLM hallucinations

When LLMs are not supplied with factual actual information, they often provide faulty, but convincing responses. This is known as hallucination, and RAG reduces the likelihood of hallucinations by providing the LLM with relevant and factional information. 

Building and deploying your first RAG pipeline

A typical RAG pipeline consists of several phases. The process of document ingestion occurs offline, and when an online query comes in, the retrieval of relevant documents and the generation of a response occurs. 

Figure 1 shows an accelerated RAG pipeline that can be built and deployed in the /NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples GitHub repo.

Figure 1. Overview of RAG pipeline components: ingest and query flows

Each logical microservice is separated into containers available in the NGC public catalog. On a high level, the architecture of a RAG system can be distilled down to the pipelines shown in Figure 1:

A recurring pipeline of document pre-processing, ingestion, and embedding generation
An inference pipeline with a user query and response generation 
Document ingestion

First, raw data from diverse sources, such as databases, documents, or live feeds, is ingested into the RAG system. To pre-process this data, LangChain provides a variety of document loaders that load data of many forms from many different sources. 

The term document loader is used loosely. Source documents do not necessarily need to be what you might think of as standard documents (PDFs, text files, and so on). For example, LangChain supports loading data from Confluence, CSV files, Outlook emails, and more. LlamaIndex also provides a variety of loaders, which can be viewed in LlamaHub.

Document pre-processing

After documents have been loaded, they are often transformed. One transformation method is text-splitting, which breaks down long text into smaller segments. This is necessary for fitting the text into the embedding model, e5-large-v2, which has a maximum token length of 512. While splitting the text sounds simple, this can be a nuanced process. 

Generating embeddings

When data is ingested, it must be transformed into a format that the system can efficiently process. Generating embeddings involves converting data into high-dimensional vectors, which represent text in a numerical format. 

Storing embeddings in vector databases

The processed data and generated embeddings are stored in specialized databases known as vector databases. These databases are optimized to handle vectorized data, enabling rapid search and retrieval operations. Storing the data in RAPIDS RAFT accelerated vector databases like Milvus guarantees that information remains accessible and can be quickly retrieved during real-time interactions.

LLMs

LLMs form the foundational generative component of the RAG pipeline. These advanced, generalized language models are trained on vast datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text. In the context of RAG, LLMs are used to generate fully formed responses based on the user query and contextual information retrieved from the vector DBs during user queries.

Querying

When a user submits a query, the RAG system uses the indexed data and vectors to perform efficient searches. The system identifies relevant information by comparing the query vector with the stored vectors in the vector DBs. The LLMs then use the retrieved data to craft appropriate responses.

Fast-track your deployment of this system by testing out this example workflow in the /NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples GitHub repo.

Get started building RAG in your enterprise

By using RAG, you can provide up-to-date and proprietary information with ease to LLMs and build a system that increases user trust, improves user experiences, and reduces hallucinations.

Their chat functionality provides a fast and natural interaction between humans and large corpora of data. For example, they can summarize and extract highlights from data or replace complex queries such as SQL queries with natural language.\xa0\n\nIt is tempting to assume that business value can be generated by these models with no extra effort, but this is unfortunately not often the case. Luckily, all that enterprises must do to extract value out of using LLMs is to augment the LLM with their own data. This can be done with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which is showcased in the NVIDIA Generative AI Examples GitHub repo for developers\xa0\n\nBy augmenting an LLM with business data, enterprises can make their AI applications agile and responsive to new developments. For instance:\n\nChatbots: Many enterprises already use AI chatbots to power basic customer interactions on their websites. With RAG, companies can build a chat experience that’s highly specific to their product. For example, questions about product specifications could easily be answered.\xa0\nCustomer service: Companies can empower live service representatives to easily answer customer questions with precise, up-to-date information.\nEnterprise search: Businesses have a wealth of knowledge across the organization, including technical documentation, company policies, IT support articles, and code repositories. Employees could query an internal search engine to retrieve information faster and more efficiently.\n\nThis post explains the benefits of using the RAG technique when building an LLM application, along with the components of a RAG pipeline. For more information after you finish this post, see RAG 101: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Questions Answered.\n\nBenefits of RAG\n\nThere are several advantages of using RAG:\n\nEmpowering LLM solutions with real-time data access\nPreserving data privacy\nMitigating LLM hallucinations\nEmpowering LLM solutions with real-time data access\n\nData is constantly changing in an enterprise. AI solutions that use LLMs can remain up-to-date and current with RAG, which facilitates direct access to additional data resources. These resources can consist of real-time and personalized data.\xa0\n\nPreserving data privacy\n\nEnsuring data privacy is crucial for enterprises. With a self-hosted LLM (demonstrated in the RAG workflow), sensitive data can be kept on-premises just like the stored data.\xa0\n\nMitigating LLM hallucinations\n\nWhen LLMs are not supplied with factual actual information, they often provide faulty, but convincing responses. This is known as hallucination, and RAG reduces the likelihood of hallucinations by providing the LLM with relevant and factional information.\xa0\n\nBuilding and deploying your first RAG pipeline\n\nA typical RAG pipeline consists of several phases. The process of document ingestion occurs offline, and when an online query comes in, the retrieval of relevant documents and the generation of a response occurs.\xa0\n\nFigure 1 shows an accelerated RAG pipeline that can be built and deployed in the /NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples GitHub repo.\n\nFigure 1. Overview of RAG pipeline components: ingest and query flows\n\nEach logical microservice is separated into containers available in the NGC public catalog. On a high level, the architecture of a RAG system can be distilled down to the pipelines shown in Figure 1:\n\nA recurring pipeline of document pre-processing, ingestion, and embedding generation\nAn inference pipeline with a user query and response generation\xa0\nDocument ingestion\n\nFirst, raw data from diverse sources, such as databases, documents, or live feeds, is ingested into the RAG system.

How AI will affect the future of search
Explore the transformative role of AI in search engines and discover how it will affect the future of search, shaping marketing strategies.
Julia McCoy on January 8, 2024 at 9:00 am | Reading time: 8 minutes
     Chat with SearchBot

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the digital landscape – leaving no room for outdated SEO tactics. As search engines increasingly leverage AI to anticipate user intent, we must completely rethink our strategies and balance human creativity and AI efficiency to stay ahead. 

Let’s explore the innovations, opportunities and pitfalls to master as AI propels search into a new era.

Search evolution: Prioritizing intent over keywords

The era of keyword stuffing is over, replaced by a focus on user intent. 

Search engines have evolved to understand the context behind queries. This shift demands a change in SEO strategies – prioritizing creativity and relevance over mere keyword density.

Today’s SEO is about aligning with user goals and pain points, not just keyword counts. Including elements like location-based services and personalized recommendations turns searches into dynamic interactions between users and your content.

Embracing semantic search

Incorporating semantic search requires a mix of data analytics and empathetic writing. This approach focuses on delivering relevant and valuable insights, aligning with E-E-A-T guidelines for expertise and trustworthiness.

In this new landscape, keyword research remains valuable but as part of a wider strategy. It’s about creating meaningful interactions and standing out in a digital world filled with information overload.

Consider Google’s BERT algorithm. It uses natural language processing to understand the real intent behind a search. This is a leap from simple keyword matching to predictive, context-aware results. 

This essentially means AI doesn’t just improve search – it anticipates our needs, often before we articulate them. 

AI does more than just understand user intent. It also brings personalization to search engines. 

By analyzing past user data like location and search history, AI can predict the future preferences of search engine users.

AI’s transformative role in SEO

AI is a pivotal force in digital marketing, making it important for content creators to understand the technology. 

It involves machine learning algorithms that analyze data to predict relevant content for search queries. 

With search engines like Google and Bing employing AI to enhance result accuracy, marketers must understand AI’s impact to remain competitive.

Leveraging AI for advanced content strategies

AI tools offer more than just enhancements to current strategies. 

They enable optimization through trend identification and advanced analytics. These tools provide insights into strategy performance, like click-through rates and page engagement. 

AI also suggests improvements based on user behavior, revolutionizing content optimization by revealing new opportunities and offering data-driven recommendations for continuous enhancement.

The balance between man and machine: The future trend?

Despite AI’s advancements, the need for human narrative crafting remains. 

This balance is where concepts like AIO and my C.R.A.F.T framework become crucial, merging machine learning with human intuition to produce compelling, search engine-friendly content.

Artificial intelligence optimization (AIO) in content creation

AI’s role in content creation marks a new era. Enter AIO writers.

It starts with AI drafting content, embedding keywords, and aligning with search engine results pages. But AI alone is not enough. A human writer trained in AIO takes over next. They take AI drafts and make them better. 

These optimized pieces attract readers and meet the criteria of modern search algorithms. They keep the language and brand voice unique.

The interesting thing about this model isn’t just about quantity. I am talking about accuracy and trustworthiness, which are essential for any high E-E-A-T content strategy. 

Marketers who embrace AIO in their strategy are leading the way – not keeping up.

Synergy of AI and human expertise in SEO

AI boosts efficiency, but the nuanced touch of human writing brings depth and appeal to the content. This collaborative process involves using AI for initial drafts and human skills for final refinements. 

Today, creating SEO-friendly content requires a careful approach. AI lays a solid groundwork, but human skill is what makes content stand out.

What C.R.A.F.T. is all about

I developed the C.R.A.F.T. framework to steer content creators in a rapidly changing digital environment, especially when working with AI-generated content. 

AI writing isn’t ready to publish as is. It lacks your personal experiences, client insights, and unique tone.

That’s where C.R.A.F.T. comes in. It empowers writers to infuse AI content with these essential human elements and ensures your content reflects you and your audience.

Here’s what it looks like. 

Cut the fluff

C.R.A.F.T. centers on concise, impactful writing. Eliminating excess words is essential in today’s information-saturated world. 

This approach aligns with Google Search Essentials (formerly Webmaster Guidelines), which prioritizes valuable content for users.

Review, edit, optimize

Transform good writing into great communication. Refine syntax and strategically integrate keywords, balancing SEO with reader appeal.

Add images, visuals, media

You need visuals. They enrich your text and help explain complex ideas. Alt tags and clear visuals also contribute to SEO by enhancing user experience and search indexing. 

Fact-check your content

Fact-checking establishes authority and combats misinformation. Truth is our responsibility as creators, reflecting Google’s E-E-A-T principles.

Trust-build

This involves adding personal stories and authoritative links to build trust with your readers.

Generative AI’s role in search results

Generative AI is redefining content ranking based on quality. This advancement challenges traditional SEO tactics, as algorithms can now create and assess content unprecedentedly.

Elevating quality standards across the board

In this competitive arena, high-quality standards become paramount. 

Google’s evolving algorithm updates now prioritize relevant, original and useful content – mirroring the objectives of generative AI.

This shift calls for stringent fact-checking and authenticity in content creation. 

Enhancing user experience through AI

Generative AI impacts more than just search rankings. It influences creative storytelling, tone differentiation, and user engagement metrics. 

The narrative around facts enhances user experience, as authoritative links within content add credibility.

However, despite AI’s advanced capabilities, the essential human element in content creation cannot be overlooked.

The blend of technology and the innate human touch in crafting compelling narratives is irreplaceable.

Adapting to AI-driven search engine marketing

The future of search engine marketing is rapidly evolving with AI advancements. Marketers must stay informed and prepare for this change. Here are key strategies:

Stay updated on AI trends: Keep abreast of the latest AI developments. Subscribe to trade publications and engage in professional discussions about AI trends and technologies. 
Understand AI challenges: Recognize AI’s opportunities and pitfalls. Generative AI, while promising, raises concerns like misinformation. Up to 80% of marketers will need teams dedicated to countering AI-generated misinformation by 2027, Gartner predicts.
Consider copyright concerns: Copyright issues are paramount with generative AI. After the 2023 ruling by the U.S. Copyright Office, navigating copyright becomes more complex, especially with AI-generated content. The ruling reminds us to make sure we humanly edit AI-generated output to maintain the human stamp and ownership of our content.
Be aware of regulatory changes: Monitor the evolving regulatory landscape for AI technologies. Anticipate and prepare for inevitable regulatory actions affecting AI use.

Marketers need to stay informed, understand challenges, navigate copyright issues, and maintain regulatory awareness to thrive in the AI-driven future of search engine marketing.

Integrating human expertise with AI in search technology

Merging human expertise with AI is becoming crucial in optimizing for search. 

This combination is not just helpful – it’s essential to master modern search algorithms.

AI brings immense processing power but lacks human-like, nuanced understanding. Marketers need to use their insights to refine AI results. This leads to a more focused approach that matches user intent, boosting efficiency.

This fusion also helps predict consumer behavior shifts that data alone might miss. Combining metrics with human empathy ensures digital strategies connect personally with users.

Creativity and predictive analytics: A powerful duo

Creativity is a core human factor and the key to standing out in a crowded market. 

When blended with AI’s predictive analytics, creativity becomes both original and data-driven, maximizing impact.

We see this partnership in action when analyzing metrics like click-through rates. Human creativity is the factor to lean into to build interest and curiosity, while AI can optimize reach based on these insights.

Making better decisions with AI and human insight 

AI is great at quickly spotting patterns helping in SEO decision-making. 

But without human strategic oversight, AI alone might miss opportunities that need human cultural understanding or trend identification.

Professionals must use AI tools to enhance, not replace, their decision-making. This approach allows for quick yet well-thought-out strategic choices.

Shaping the future of search with AI

AI is reshaping search. It’s changing how we create content, adapt to algorithms, and stay ahead in marketing. The future of search isn’t just about keywords – it’s about understanding and utilizing AI.

Remember the milestones that got us here. Keep my C.R.A.F.T framework handy as you refine your SEO approach: Cut through the noise, enhance with custom visuals, and build trust with authentic stories.

Understand how to function in the role of AIO – AIOs are not just helpers; they’re co-creators. Generative AI is not a threat but an ally for those who learn to collaborate effectively.

The takeaway? How AI will affect the future of search hinges on our ability to blend human ingenuity with machine efficiency. Master this, and the way forward is bright.

It empowers writers to infuse AI content with these essential human elements and ensures your content reflects you and your audience.\n\nHere’s what it looks like.\xa0\n\nCut the fluff\n\nC.R.A.F.T. centers on concise, impactful writing.\xa0Eliminating excess words is essential in today’s information-saturated world.\xa0\n\nThis approach aligns with Google Search Essentials (formerly Webmaster Guidelines), which prioritizes valuable content for users.\n\nReview, edit, optimize\n\nTransform good writing into great communication.\xa0Refine syntax and strategically integrate keywords, balancing SEO with reader appeal.\n\nAdd images, visuals, media\n\nYou need visuals. They enrich your text and help explain complex ideas. Alt tags and clear visuals also contribute to SEO by enhancing user experience and search indexing.\xa0\n\nFact-check your content\n\nFact-checking establishes authority and combats misinformation.\xa0Truth is our responsibility as creators, reflecting Google’s E-E-A-T principles.\n\nTrust-build\n\nThis involves adding personal stories and authoritative links to build trust with your readers.\n\nGet the newsletter search marketers rely on.\n\nBusiness email address\nSign me up!\n\nSee terms.\n\nGenerative AI’s role in search results\n\nGenerative AI is redefining content ranking based on quality.\xa0This advancement challenges traditional SEO tactics, as algorithms can now create and assess content unprecedentedly.\n\nElevating quality standards across the board\n\nIn this competitive arena, high-quality standards become paramount.\xa0\n\nGoogle’s evolving algorithm updates now prioritize relevant, original and useful content – mirroring the objectives of generative AI.\n\nThis shift calls for stringent fact-checking and authenticity in content creation.\xa0\n\nEnhancing user experience through AI\n\nGenerative AI impacts more than just search rankings. It influences creative storytelling, tone differentiation, and user engagement metrics.\xa0\n\nThe narrative around facts enhances user experience, as authoritative links within content add credibility.\n\nHowever, despite AI’s advanced capabilities, the essential human element in content creation cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe blend of technology and the innate human touch in crafting compelling narratives is irreplaceable.\n\nAdapting to AI-driven search engine marketing\n\nThe future of search engine marketing is rapidly evolving with AI advancements. Marketers must stay informed and prepare for this change. Here are key strategies:\n\nStay updated on AI trends:\xa0Keep abreast of the latest AI developments. Subscribe to trade publications and engage in professional discussions about AI trends and technologies.\xa0\nUnderstand AI challenges:\xa0Recognize AI’s opportunities and pitfalls. Generative AI, while promising, raises concerns like misinformation. Up to 80% of marketers will need teams dedicated to countering AI-generated misinformation by 2027, Gartner predicts.\nConsider copyright concerns: Copyright issues are paramount with generative AI. After the 2023 ruling by the U.S. Copyright Office, navigating copyright becomes more complex, especially with AI-generated content. The ruling reminds us to make sure we humanly edit AI-generated output to maintain the human stamp and ownership of our content.\nBe aware of regulatory changes:\xa0Monitor the evolving regulatory landscape for AI technologies. Anticipate and prepare for inevitable regulatory actions affecting AI use.\n\nMarketers need to stay informed, understand challenges, navigate copyright issues, and maintain regulatory awareness to thrive in the AI-driven future of search engine marketing.\n\nIntegrating human expertise with AI in search technology\n\nMerging human expertise with AI is becoming crucial in optimizing for search.\xa0\n\nThis combination is not just helpful – it’s essential to master modern search algorithms.\n\nAI brings immense processing power but lacks human-like, nuanced understanding. Marketers need to use their insights to refine AI results. This leads to a more focused approach that matches user intent, boosting efficiency.\n\nThis fusion also helps predict consumer behavior shifts that data alone might miss. Combining metrics with human empathy ensures digital strategies connect personally with users.\n\nCreativity and predictive analytics: A powerful duo\n\nCreativity is a core human factor and the key to standing out in a crowded market.\xa0\n\nWhen blended with AI’s predictive analytics, creativity becomes both original and data-driven, maximizing impact.\n\nWe see this partnership in action when analyzing metrics like click-through rates. Human creativity is the factor to lean into to build interest and curiosity, while AI can optimize reach based on these insights.\n\nMaking better decisions with AI and human insight\xa0\n\nAI is great at quickly spotting patterns helping in SEO decision-making.\xa0\n\nBut without human strategic oversight, AI alone might miss opportunities that need human cultural understanding or trend identification.\n\nProfessionals must use AI tools to enhance, not replace, their decision-making. This approach allows for quick yet well-thought-out strategic choices.\n\nShaping the future of search with AI\n\nAI is reshaping search. It’s changing how we create content, adapt to algorithms, and stay ahead in marketing. The future of search isn’t just about keywords – it’s about understanding and utilizing AI.\n\nRemember the milestones that got us here. Keep my C.R.A.F.T framework handy as you refine your SEO approach: Cut through the noise, enhance with custom visuals, and build trust with authentic stories.\n\nUnderstand how to function in the role of AIO – AIOs are not just helpers; they’re co-creators. Generative AI is not a threat but an ally for those who learn to collaborate effectively.\n\nThe takeaway? How AI will affect the future of search hinges on our ability to blend human ingenuity with machine efficiency. Master this, and the way forward is bright.\xa0\n\nGet the newsletter search marketers rely on.\n\nBusiness email address\nSign me up!\n\nSee terms.\n\nContributing authors are invited to create content for Search Engine Land and are chosen for their expertise and contribution to the search community.

AI-powered search engines are disrupting traditional search and creating new opportunities for marketers in an increasingly fragmented digital landscape.
The Gist
Changing search landscape. AI-powered search engines are reshaping the search landscape and offering more personalized answers than traditional search paradigms.
Shift in consumer behavior. Younger generations are moving away from traditional search engines and favoring platforms like TikTok and Instagram for discovery.
Marketing strategy evolution. As search engines fragment, marketers must adapt by embracing multi-channel strategies and rethinking their martech and adtech stacks.

The digital search landscape is entering a period of dramatic change, one that could rival Google’s ascension two decades ago. The rise of AI-powered search engines like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Perplexity, along with Google’s own Gemini, is forcing businesses and marketers to reexamine their strategies. Users are increasingly drawn to platforms that offer more personalized, direct answers, which presents a challenge for traditional search paradigms.

To add even more complexity, younger generations are bypassing search engines altogether, and they favor discovery through platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Nearly 40% of Gen Z users now prefer social media platforms over traditional search engines for discovery. For marketers, these shifts bring both opportunity and risk. They raise fundamental questions about the future of digital advertising and its reliance on Google’s dominance.

Is Google at Risk From AI-Powered Search Engines?

Google’s hold on the search market, while still commanding, is showing early signs of strain. Its global market share, which was 93.37% in early 2023, has declined to 89.33% as of October 2024. This erosion comes as privacy-conscious consumers and those seeking AI-powered alternatives explore new options. AI-native platforms like SearchGPT and Perplexity are reshaping search by answering longer, more complex queries with greater nuance.

Google has countered these challengers with its own innovations, including AI-powered overviews that now reach over a billion users monthly. Yet, industry analysts, including Gartner, predict that by 2026, web traffic from traditional search engines could drop by 25% as AI-driven tools gain traction. This paints an uncertain future for a company that has shaped the core infrastructure of the digital advertising ecosystem.

The Potential Upside of Google’s Decline in Search

For years, marketers have voiced frustration over the disproportionate weight of their budgets funneled to a few major players, primarily Google and Meta. In theory, the rise of AI-powered search engines and a more fragmented search landscape could create healthier competition and create new advertising opportunities across diverse platforms.

However, there’s a catch: Much of the marketing and advertising technology ecosystem — spanning martech tools, adtech platforms and campaign strategies — is built around Google’s dominance. If Google’s position weakens significantly, these investments may lose their effectiveness, and this could force marketers to retool everything from analytics to ad delivery mechanisms.

This uncertainty raises critical questions for businesses: How do you pivot strategies that are deeply embedded in the Google ecosystem? Can your marketing technology stack keep pace with shifting consumer behavior and a more diversified search environment? While the potential benefits of competition are appealing, the risks of disruption are equally significant.

What Should Marketers Do Next?

The fragmentation of search is already reshaping consumer behavior. Research shows users increasingly utilize platforms like TikTok for search, while traditional search engines have experienced a 9% decline in initial queries. For marketers, this diversification presents both challenges and opportunities.

Embrace Multi-Channel Strategies: As search splinters, marketers must distribute efforts across multiple platforms, from Reddit and Quora to emerging social and AI-driven tools.
Prepare for Platform-Specific Investments: Each platform demands unique strategies tailored to user behavior, ad formats and engagement styles.
Rethink Martech and Adtech Alignments: Teams must evaluate their technology stacks for adaptability and make sure they remain effective across a broader range of platforms.

Interestingly, this shift could also reduce reliance on monopolistic ad pricing. Diversifying platforms may introduce fairer competition for ad placement, potentially lowering customer acquisition costs. However, this will require marketers to invest in advanced analytics and automation to navigate a more complex ecosystem effectively.

However, it also poses risks, as distancing from Google could disrupt existing digital infrastructure, requiring marketers to adapt or fall behind. Success will hinge on experimentation, investment in specific strategies and leveraging AI and alternative search platforms. As 2025 approaches, marketers must prepare to thrive in a landscape where the future is uncertain.

Is Google Losing Search Market Share?
By Rand FishkinOctober 7, 2024

A recent Wall Street Journal made the top of feeds in the digital marketing world, claiming that Google is on the precipice of losing the lead in the search advertising wars. Supposedly, in 2025, for the first time, Google may fall under 50% of market share in search advertising (according to an eMarketer report the WSJ cites).

The WSJ points to three factors: the rise of TikTok, the growth of AI search engines (Perplexity is prominently mentioned), and the antitrust pressure Google faces in their monopoly trial.

But… on investigation of the data, I think all of these wrong, and digital marketers should be wary of being misled by hypothetical causes vs. what’s really going on…

Transcript

This article right here, was at the top of my LinkedIn feed. It was, notable in my threads feed. It was in Twitter, which I I rarely check. But this Wall Street Journal article is really interesting.

I I’m gonna show you. It it seemed a little fishy to me as well, and that’s because when I read it, it sort of made the case that, AI search like like chat g p t and perplexity in particular are taking market share away from Google search advertising revenue. Not search market share, search advertising revenue and TikTok as well. Now, as a percentage of digital, search is shrinking a tiny bit.

I I thought I would interrogate the core assess assertions that that the article is making because because I found it so fishy. And, this from the Winterberry group, this year was I think I think pretty a pretty decent assessment. It might be off by a little bit, but you can see search is still growing. Right?

So search advertising, we’re talking about bidding on keywords.

This is on Google and Bing, but also potentially on perplexity which which according to Wall Street Journal has not launched search advertising yet but will and TikTok which has but it’s very very nascent and not a lot of people, search TikTok. They they mostly But it’s still growing. Right? So search advertising is not declining, therefore, that’s not the cause.

I also tried to figure out if Google search market share is somehow in jeopardy. And according to our latest data, it’s Datos, our clickstream provider. Right? I did a big study, back in the spring.

Certainly does not look that way. And stat counter confirms that Google is basically as strong as it’s ever been. What you see right here is very close to ninety percent. I think it’s eighty eight percent, market share in the United States and more than ninety percent globally.

Google stock did take a little bit of a beating over the summer, but to be honest, so did every major tech stock, and and a lot of the S and P five hundred overall. So that that didn’t seem to be what was driving this.

We looked at the data as well. So I did a recent webinar with Datos, and we looked at, whether people who search Google are switching to AI search engines. Right? Lots of people in your LinkedIn feed are probably telling you that they are especially in b to b software world and tech world. Well, you can see here that, the percent who use only traditional search engines, never used, any AI engine is eighty three percent.

And by August twenty twenty four almost seventeen percent of people in Datos’ panel at least which is which is millions of users worldwide and and and some millions, in the US.

Seventeen percent as of August, so that’s pretty high, but ninety nine percent of those AI users also use Google. On average, users are searching Google two hundred times per month which is up from last year.

So that suggests Google search advertising business should be stronger not weaker. Now you can see that the searches per search user declined from May to August. That’s actually just seasonality. That’s pretty typical.

You can see the that search MAUs on Amazon. We’re also lower in August, and that is, again, because people are buying fewer things, during the non school year during the summer.

But if TikTok is this threat that the Wall Street Journal is making it out to be, why aren’t they calling out, look at DuckDuckGo. It’s way up here. Right? And August was stronger for it in at least in monthly active users.

EBay should have been mentioned in there. Right? Walmart. These are all ahead of TikTok, and perplexity is way down here. Granted, perplexity is small. They’re growing faster.

But, for ChatchieBT and for perplexity, we looked at the number of times people search per month. It’s thirteen and a half or sixteen and a half. So it’s it’s just doesn’t add up. Right?

Like, yes, these platforms are growing, but perplexity grew from, you know, whatever thirteen percent to seventeen percent, it grew from twelve to sixteen. So maybe in ten years if they continue their growth at the current rate, they might be a challenge to Google. But right now, something’s weird. So what the heck is going on here?

So I looked at the study. Right? Because because, the Wall Street Journal quotes eMarketer in saying that Google’s share of search advertising will be under fifty percent for the first time in a decade.

Take a look at this. So they’re they’re probably right. This was twenty twenty three, this is twenty twenty four, and so twenty twenty five will probably be right around fifty percent, it could be under fifty percent. What’s happening? Oh, Amazon is growing a little bit and other is growing a little bit.

Well that that is not what the article suggested.

It didn’t it barely mentioned Amazon, here’s where search advertising, search advertising spend is going. Right? Sorry. All digital advertising spend is going, and you can see that in search advertising Amazon is the one that’s growing. Look at this, they’re growing faster, right, than Google is growing in terms of percentage, but they’re actually growing fewer dollars. So Google is growing more dollar wise, it’s just that Amazon’s growing faster as a percent because they were a smaller percent before.

That’s not much of a story.

I guess Amazon is selling more ads because they’re not actually growing their number of searches seasonally adjusted by all that much.

But what we can see is that I went back in time and looked at the previous, you know, decade and look look back in twenty eighteen. Right? Google’s, market share of all search advertising was around seventy percent and then it fell by, you know, I guess this this slope ended up being sharper than was expected in March of twenty twenty three when the study was put together. And as for net revenue, you know, you can see them at in the seventies, and now Amazon has grown, Microsoft has grown a little bit, Yelp has grown a little bit. Others have entered.

My my big takeaway actually is that if you look at the other bucket, that’s the most interesting bucket, but it’s not TikTok and AI. It’s Walmart and Instacart and Spotify and Apple and Hulu, to to be frank. Right? Like, these companies which did not previously have significant advertising revenue, digital advertising revenue, and offerings because Walmart and Instacart in particular got grouped into search advertising because people use keywords to search for them. That’s where a lot of that growth is coming from, and it’s nipping away at Google’s heels, but Google continues to grow.

So I I don’t know whether I call this a non story, but I think this is why media literacy and data literacy is so important. Because if you just see the Wall Street Journal’s headline in your feed, you’re gonna think to yourself, oh man, is Google dying? Are they losing search market share? And that’s not what’s going on, and that’s why it pays to interrogate these, articles and and question what’s really happening.

A Comprehensive Guide for RAG Pipeline

RAG has come up as an advanced way for businesses to enhance their LLM performance in order to produce accurate answers. This blog is your complete guide to understanding the RAG pipeline, components, benefits, challenges, and the step-by-step process to build and integrate it.

With evolving AI, businesses still face one major challenge- how to ensure that AI-generated responses are accurate, relevant, and tailored to specific queries?

Traditional language models rely on training data that can further lead to generic and inaccurate answers. On the other hand, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline addresses this problem by combining information retrieval and response generation.

RAG development services help generate the perfect response by searching external knowledge sources to find relevant data and using large language models to produce accurate responses.

This blog will help you understand everything about RAG, from its components to benefits and challenges, as well as how to build a RAG pipeline.

Key Takeaways
RAG pipelines enhance accuracy by retrieving relevant data before generating responses, reducing errors, and enabling precise, domain-specific answers.
Steps for building a RAG pipeline include defining use cases, preprocessing data, embedding for retrieval, integrating with a language model, and refining for accuracy.
Optimize embeddings, choose the right vector store, use effective chunking, and maintain a feedback loop to improve response relevance for smooth implementation.
Common challenges include data consistency, model alignment, integration complexity, and error handling. Robust management and fine-tuning are essential.

To begin with, we need to understand the RAG pipeline in detail.

What is a RAG Pipeline?

Image source

RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, is a method in Artificial Intelligence that combines two steps: retrieving information and generating responses. In simple terms, it first searches a knowledge source to find relevant information based on the users’ questions.

Then, it uses LLM like GPT and more to create a detailed and context-aware response. This approach helps the AI to provide accurate and informed answers, especially for complex or specific queries.

Components of RAG Pipeline

Components of a RAG pipeline include the following:

Embedding Model

It generates query embeddings from the input query, transforming the text into a dense vector representation that can be used to find relevant data in vector stores.

Vector Stores

This component stores and organizes embeddings for quick access and retrieval based on similarity scores. When a query is processed, vector stores help locate the most relevant documents or passages.

Text Splitter and Chunking

Chunking or splitting large documents into manageable sections helps the RAG pipeline efficiently process and retrieve relevant information by enabling more precise retrieval and generation.

Large Language Model (LLM)

Uses retrieved chunks and prompts engineering to generate responses. The LLM combines retrieved data with its own generative capabilities, guided by specific hyperparameters to balance response quality and relevance.

Utility Functions and Visualization Tools

Utility functions assist with tasks like scoring and ranking retrieval results, while visualization tools provide insights into retrieval and generation processes, helping users and developers understand and refine the pipeline.

It is always a question of whether businesses should invest in RAG pipelines and what types of companies should. To answer this question, we have explained the benefits of RAG pipeline LLM in the section below.

Benefits of RAG Pipelines

As technology evolves, it is crucial for brands to integrate these into their daily operations in order to automate and save time and money. RAG pipeline is one such tech. Some of its vital benefits include:

Contextually Relevant Responses

By integrating retrieval-augmented generation, the pipeline pulls contextually relevant data from external sources. It helps provide precise answers rather than relying solely on general information from the model.

Enhanced Accuracy Through Document Extraction

The RAG pipeline uses document extraction to locate and leverage specific pieces of information from large datasets to ensure accurate responses even for detailed, domain-specific queries.

Domain-Specific Question-Answering

By retrieving external data as context, the pipeline enables domain-specific question-answering tailored to particular industries or knowledge areas, making it a highly versatile solution for specialized use cases.

Reduced Hallucinations in Responses

With real-time retrieval and LlamaIndex integration, the RAG pipeline reduces hallucinations (fabricated or inaccurate responses) by grounding answers in verified data rather than purely relying on the model’s assumptions.

Improved Generative Capabilities with Large Language Models

The RAG pipeline leverages the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which, combined with retrieved data, produce responses that are not only accurate but also well-structured and nuanced.

Question-Answering and Real-Time Retrieval

The use of TruLens enhances real-time evaluation and feedback mechanisms, allowing for more reliable question-answering in real-time retrieval scenarios.

Now that you know how RAG pipelines can benefit in various ways, the next section explains how to build a RAG system.

How to Build a RAG Pipeline?

The next question is how to build a RAG pipeline that helps businesses solve specific problems. Here is the step-by-step process.

Define Use Case and Knowledge Base

The first step in building a pipeline is identifying the use cases. Determine the purpose of the RAG pipeline, such as customer support and research assistance.

Once you have identified the use cases, choose or create a data source like documents, articles, or structured databases from which the pipeline will retrieve information from.

Preprocess and Index Data

Next, use a text splitter to divide large documents into smaller and manageable sections or “chunks” for easier retrieval. Then, an embedding model is used to convert text chunks into vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.

Once done, store these embeddings in a vector store like Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

Build the Retrieval System

The next step to building a RAG pipeline is using query embedding. For each new query, you can use the same embedding model to convert it into a query embedding. Further, perform a similarity search within the vector store to retrieve the most relevant text chunks based on similarity scores.

Integrate with a Language Model

To integrate the pipeline with a language model, send the retrieved text chunks along with the query to an LLM, structuring it into a prompt that the model can use as context. The LLM will then generate a response, informed by the retrieved data, to ensure it is contextually accurate.

Evaluate and Optimize the Pipeline

Next, functions for scoring and ranking retrieved results should be added to ensure the most relevant data is used in the generation. In order to add a feedback loop, you can use tools like TruLens to adjust parameters and reduce “hallucinations.”

Adjust hyperparameters to tune model settings, chunk sizes, and similarity thresholds to improve response quality and retrieval accuracy.

Deploy and Monitor Performance

The last step is to deploy and implement the RAG pipeline within your application or API. Further, use tools for logging and visualizing performance in order to refine the model as needed for a better user experience.

Best Practices for Implementing a RAG Pipeline

In order to ensure that the RAG pipeline performs well, it is important to integrate it well with the existing systems. Here are some best practices for implementing the RAG pipeline:

Optimize Embedding Models for Relevance

Carefully select and fine-tune your embedding model to improve the quality of retrieved data. As this model is responsible for converting text into vectors, you must choose an embedding model that aligns with your data type and domain.

Select the RIght Vector

Each vector has unique strengths, from speed to scalability. Hence, choosing the right vector store is essential. You must evaluate factors like latency, query speed, and integration compatibility with your existing tech stack to find the best fit.

Chunk Text Strategically

For smooth integration, you must also divide large documents into manageable “chunks” or segments to increase retrieval accuracy. Also, ensure that chunks are the right size and experiment with these to see which balance works best with your knowledge base.

Maintain a Continuous Feedback Loop

Next, keep a continuous feedback loop as it allows for regular improvements by adjusting the RAG pipeline based on user interaction and responses. It also helps address issues like hallucinations and irrelevant responses.

Challenges With RAG Pipeline

Integrating a RAG pipeline with the existing businesses comes along with some challenges and these include:

Data Consistency

Maintaining consistent and high-quality data across various sources can be challenging, especially when integrating structured and unstructured data. Inconsistent data can lead to poor retrieval results and inaccurate generative outputs.

Complexity in Data Retrieval

Efficiently retrieving relevant information from large and diverse datasets can be difficult. Ensuring that the retrieved data matches the user query or context is crucial for generating accurate responses.

Model Alignment

Aligning retrieval models with generative models requires fine-tuning to ensure that the information pulled from the database or knowledge base is properly synthesized. Misalignment can lead to irrelevant or incorrectly generated content.

Integration Complexity

Integrating the RAG pipeline with existing systems can be complex, especially when dealing with legacy systems or incompatible software. Ensuring seamless communication between components is key to a smooth integration process.

Error Handling

Errors in either the retrieval or generation phase can lead to faulty outputs or system failures. Developing a robust error-handling mechanism is crucial to prevent disruption and ensure continuous, reliable performance.

This blog is your complete guide to understanding the RAG pipeline, components, benefits, challenges, and the step-by-step process to build and integrate it.\n\nHarjyot Kaur\n25 November 2024\nRAG\nTable of Contents\n\nWith evolving AI, businesses still face one major challenge- how to ensure that AI-generated responses are accurate, relevant, and tailored to specific queries?\n\nTraditional language models rely on training data that can further lead to generic and inaccurate answers. On the other hand, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline addresses this problem by combining information retrieval and response generation.\n\nRAG development services help generate the perfect response by searching external knowledge sources to find relevant data and using large language models to produce accurate responses.\n\nThis blog will help you understand everything about RAG, from its components to benefits and challenges, as well as how to build a RAG pipeline.\n\nKey Takeaways\nRAG pipelines enhance accuracy by retrieving relevant data before generating responses, reducing errors, and enabling precise, domain-specific answers.\nSteps for building a RAG pipeline include defining use cases, preprocessing data, embedding for retrieval, integrating with a language model, and refining for accuracy.\nOptimize embeddings, choose the right vector store, use effective chunking, and maintain a feedback loop to improve response relevance for smooth implementation.\nCommon challenges include data consistency, model alignment, integration complexity, and error handling. Robust management and fine-tuning are essential.\n\nTo begin with, we need to understand the RAG pipeline in detail.\n\nWhat is a RAG Pipeline?\n\nImage source\n\nRAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, is a method in Artificial Intelligence that combines two steps: retrieving information and generating responses. In simple terms, it first searches a knowledge source to find relevant information based on the users’ questions.\n\nThen, it uses LLM like GPT and more to create a detailed and context-aware response. This approach helps the AI to provide accurate and informed answers, especially for complex or specific queries.\n\nComponents of RAG Pipeline\n\nComponents of a RAG pipeline include the following:\n\nEmbedding Model\n\nIt generates query embeddings from the input query, transforming the text into a dense vector representation that can be used to find relevant data in vector stores.\n\nVector Stores\n\nThis component stores and organizes embeddings for quick access and retrieval based on similarity scores. When a query is processed, vector stores help locate the most relevant documents or passages.\n\nText Splitter and Chunking\n\nChunking or splitting large documents into manageable sections helps the RAG pipeline efficiently process and retrieve relevant information by enabling more precise retrieval and generation.\n\nLarge Language Model (LLM)\n\nUses retrieved chunks and prompts engineering to generate responses. The LLM combines retrieved data with its own generative capabilities, guided by specific hyperparameters to balance response quality and relevance.\n\nUtility Functions and Visualization Tools\n\nUtility functions assist with tasks like scoring and ranking retrieval results, while visualization tools provide insights into retrieval and generation processes, helping users and developers understand and refine the pipeline.\n\nIt is always a question of whether businesses should invest in RAG pipelines and what types of companies should. To answer this question, we have explained the benefits of RAG pipeline LLM in the section below.\n\nMaster RAG Pipelines for Advanced AI Performance\n\nLearn to integrate retrieval and generation seamlessly for smarter and faster AI solutions.\n\nGet Started Now -->\nBenefits of RAG Pipelines\n\nAs technology evolves, it is crucial for brands to integrate these into their daily operations in order to automate and save time and money. RAG pipeline is one such tech. Some of its vital benefits include:\n\nContextually Relevant Responses\n\nBy integrating retrieval-augmented generation, the pipeline pulls contextually relevant data from external sources. It helps provide precise answers rather than relying solely on general information from the model.\n\nEnhanced Accuracy Through Document Extraction\n\nThe RAG pipeline uses document extraction to locate and leverage specific pieces of information from large datasets to ensure accurate responses even for detailed, domain-specific queries.\n\nDomain-Specific Question-Answering\n\nBy retrieving external data as context, the pipeline enables domain-specific question-answering tailored to particular industries or knowledge areas, making it a highly versatile solution for specialized use cases.\n\nReduced Hallucinations in Responses\n\nWith real-time retrieval and LlamaIndex integration, the RAG pipeline reduces hallucinations (fabricated or inaccurate responses) by grounding answers in verified data rather than purely relying on the model’s assumptions.\n\nImproved Generative Capabilities with Large Language Models\n\nThe RAG pipeline leverages the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which, combined with retrieved data, produce responses that are not only accurate but also well-structured and nuanced.\n\nQuestion-Answering and Real-Time Retrieval\n\nThe use of TruLens enhances real-time evaluation and feedback mechanisms, allowing for more reliable question-answering in real-time retrieval scenarios.\n\nNow that you know how RAG pipelines can benefit in various ways, the next section explains how to build a RAG system.\n\nHow to Build a RAG Pipeline?\n\nThe next question is how to build a RAG pipeline that helps businesses solve specific problems. Here is the step-by-step process.\n\nDefine Use Case and Knowledge Base\n\nThe first step in building a pipeline is identifying the use cases. Determine the purpose of the RAG pipeline, such as customer support and research assistance.\n\nOnce you have identified the use cases, choose or create a data source like documents, articles, or structured databases from which the pipeline will retrieve information from.\n\nPreprocess and Index Data\n\nNext, use a text splitter to divide large documents into smaller and manageable sections or “chunks” for easier retrieval. Then, an embedding model is used to convert text chunks into vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.\n\nOnce done, store these embeddings in a vector store like Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS for efficient similarity-based retrieval.\n\nBuild the Retrieval System\n\nThe next step to building a RAG pipeline is using query embedding. For each new query, you can use the same embedding model to convert it into a query embedding. Further, perform a similarity search within the vector store to retrieve the most relevant text chunks based on similarity scores.\n\nIntegrate with a Language Model\n\nTo integrate the pipeline with a language model, send the retrieved text chunks along with the query to an LLM, structuring it into a prompt that the model can use as context. The LLM will then generate a response, informed by the retrieved data, to ensure it is contextually accurate.\n\nEvaluate and Optimize the Pipeline\n\nNext, functions for scoring and ranking retrieved results should be added to ensure the most relevant data is used in the generation. In order to add a feedback loop, you can use tools like TruLens to adjust parameters and reduce “hallucinations.”\n\nAdjust hyperparameters to tune model settings, chunk sizes, and similarity thresholds to improve response quality and retrieval accuracy.\n\nDeploy and Monitor Performance\n\nThe last step is to deploy and implement the RAG pipeline within your application or API. Further, use tools for logging and visualizing performance in order to refine the model as needed for a better user experience.\n\nBest Practices for Implementing a RAG Pipeline\n\nIn order to ensure that the RAG pipeline performs well, it is important to integrate it well with the existing systems.

ChatGPT’s search surge: 1% market share predicted by 2025
ChatGPT today just made ChatGPT search now available to all free ChatGPT users. Could this help further fuel adoption of ChatGPT search?

Could ChatGPT search have a 1% share of the search market by sometime next year? Yes, according to new internal data that enterprise SEO platform shared today with Search Engine Land.

“For the first time we can see a trajectory where ChatGPT could cross the magic 1% market share threshold sometime next year,” according to Jim Yu, founder and executive chair of BrightEdge.

Why we care. AI search is evolving quickly. It is important to watch how people adopt AI search because it may alter the way people discover you, your brand, or your website. We’re watching it happen, month after month, right now. And with ChatGPT search now available to all free users, this growth could further accelerate.

ChatGPT vs. Perplexity. ChatGPT is now 6x larger than Perplexity, according to an LLM referral analysis of November traffic by BrightEdge. Also, search traffic from ChatGPT (up 44%) and Perplexity (up 71%) continues to grow month over month.

But. Google is still far and away the leader, with 92.4% of referral traffic coming from Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft Bing’s market share was 4.2% in November.

Wait… Maybe you heard that Rand Fishkin, CEO and co-founder of SparkToro, last month estimated ChatGPT’s search market share was 4.33%, based on data from SimilarWeb and Datos (a Semrush company)? How is there such a big difference and confusion over the market share numbers?

Well, this BrightEdge analysis is based on referral data. Also, Fishkin later downplayed the 4% figure during his BrightonSEO keynote, because not every prompt/chat is a “search.”

So if you heard that ChatGPT’s search market share is 4%, you can safely call that stat wrong and disregard it.

ChatGPT Market Share: 2025 Trend

Below you will find the YTD 2025 trend of ChatGPT’s market share in the generative AI chatbot space. As the pioneer and marketplace leader, it has the most to lose, and it has seen a decline in market share this year at the hands of its many smaller competitors.

NOTE: ChatGPT’s market share includes that of Bing’s Copilot product, as they both use the same underlying system; the difference is only that Microsoft Copilot personalizes ChatGPT based on user data in the Microsoft ecosystem.

January 2024	76.4%
February 2024	76.1%
March 2024	75.8%

Google Gemini Market Share: 2025 Trend

February 2024	15.5%
March 2024	14.8%

Perplexity Market Share: 2025 Trend

Below you will find the YTD 2025 trend of Perplexity’s market share in the generative AI chatbot space. While its growth may not look significant, it has taken some market share from ChatGPT and Gemini this year.
