Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be state-of-the-art in many cases of supervised learning, but programming an ANN manually can be a challenging task. As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.

With the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.

Using artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.

Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.

The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.

TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.

Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.

TensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.

TensorFlow Advantages
Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.
Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.
Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.
Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).
Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.
Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.
Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.

TensorFlow Disadvantages
Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.
Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.
Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.
GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.
TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
PyTorch Overview

PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.

The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.

PyTorch 2.0

PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.

For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.

Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.

PyTorch Advantages
PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.
Easier to learn.  Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.
Debugging. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).
Dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
Data parallelism. The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores. Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.
Community. PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.
Distributed Training. PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.
PyTorch Disadvantages
Lacks model serving in production. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.
Limited monitoring and visualization interfaces. While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.
Not as extensive as TensorFlow. PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

 

Comparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
1.) Performance Comparison

The following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.

The table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.

2.) Accuracy

The PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.

The validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.

3.) Training Time and Memory Usage

The above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).

While the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.

The memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.

4.) Ease of Use

PyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.

On the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.

Moreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.

 

Differences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary

The answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.

In general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.

PyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.

TensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.

Another major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.

 

Comparison List
Feature	PyTorch	TensorFlow
Ease of Use	More Pythonic syntax and easier to debug	A steeper learning curve requires more boilerplate code

Research	Often used for research due to its flexibility and ease of use	Often used for production applications due to its speed and scalability
Math Library	PyTorch uses TorchScript for tensor manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations	TensorFlow uses its own math library for both tensor manipulation and numerical computations
Keras Integration	PyTorch does not have a native Keras integration	TensorFlow has a native Keras integration which simplifies model building and training

PyTorch and TensorFlow are two popular software frameworks used for building machine learning and deep learning models.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
PyTorch is a relatively young deep learning framework that is more Python-friendly and ideal for research, prototyping and dynamic projects.
TensorFlow is a mature deep learning framework with strong visualization capabilities and several options for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms.

Deep learning seeks to develop human-like computers to solve real-world problems, all by using special brain-like architectures called artificial neural networks. To help develop these architectures, tech giants like Meta and Google have released various frameworks for the Python deep learning environment, making it easier to learn, build and train diversified neural networks.

In this article, we’ll compare two widely used deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow.

 

What Is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that supports Python, C++ and Java. It is commonly used to develop machine learning models for computer vision, natural language processing and other deep learning tasks. PyTorch was created by the team at Meta AI and open sourced on GitHub in 2017. 

PyTorch has gained popularity for its simplicity, ease of use, dynamic computational graph and efficient memory usage, which we’ll discuss in more detail later.

 

What Is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework for Python, C++, Java and JavaScript. It can be used to build machine learning models for a range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing and task automation. TensorFlow was created by developers at Google and released in 2015. 

TensorFlow is widely applied by companies to develop and automate new systems. It draws its reputation from its distributed training support, scalable production and deployment options, and support for various devices like Android.

Difference Between PyTorch vs. TensorFlow

The key difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the way they execute code. Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type tensor. You can imagine a tensor as a multidimensional array shown in the below picture:

 

1. Mechanism: Dynamic vs. Static Graph Definition

TensorFlow is a framework composed of two core building blocks:

A library for defining computational graphs and runtime for executing such graphs on a variety of different hardware.
A computational graph which has many advantages (but more on that in just a moment).

A computational graph is an abstract way of describing computations as a directed graph. A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. It’s a set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

When you run code in TensorFlow, the computation graphs are defined statically. All communication with the outer world is performed via tf.Session object and tf.Placeholder, which are tensors that will be substituted by external data at runtime. For example, consider the following code snippet. 

This is how a computational graph is generated in a static way before the code is run in TensorFlow. The core advantage of having a computational graph is allowing parallelism or dependency driving scheduling which makes training faster and more efficient.

Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch has two core building blocks: 

Imperative and dynamic building of computational graphs.
Autograds: Performs automatic differentiation of the dynamic graphs.

As you can see in the animation below, the graphs change and execute nodes as you go with no special session interfaces or placeholders. Overall, the framework is more tightly integrated with the Python language and feels more native most of the time. Hence, PyTorch is more of a Pythonic framework and TensorFlow feels like a completely new language.

These differ a lot in the software fields based on the framework you use. TensorFlow provides a way of implementing dynamic graphs using a library called TensorFlow Fold, but PyTorch has it inbuilt.

2. Distributed Training

One main feature that distinguishes PyTorch from TensorFlow is data parallelism. PyTorch optimizes performance by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution from Python. In TensorFlow, you’ll have to manually code and fine tune every operation to be run on a specific device to allow distributed training. However, you can replicate everything in TensorFlow from PyTorch but you need to put in more effort. Below is the code snippet explaining how simple it is to implement distributed training for a model in PyTorch.

3. Visualization

When it comes to visualization of the training process, TensorFlow takes the lead. Data visualization helps the developer track the training process and debug in a more convenient way. TensorFlow’s visualization library is called TensorBoard. PyTorch developers use Visdom, however, the features provided by Visdom are very minimalistic and limited, so TensorBoard scores a point in visualizing the training process.

Features of TensorBoard
Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Visualizing the computational graph (ops and layers).
Viewing histograms of weights, biases or other tensors as they change over time.
Displaying images, text and audio data.
Profiling TensorFlow programs.
Visualizing training in TensorBoard.
Features of Visdom 
Handling callbacks.
Plotting graphs and details.
Managing environments.
Visualizing training in Visdom.
4. Production Deployment

When it comes to deploying trained models to production, TensorFlow is the clear winner. We can directly deploy models in TensorFlow using TensorFlow serving which is a framework that uses REST Client API.

In PyTorch, these production deployments became easier to handle than in its latest 1.0 stable version, but it doesn’t provide any framework to deploy models directly on to the web. You’ll have to use either Flask or Django as the backend server. So, TensorFlow serving may be a better option if performance is a concern.

5. Defining a Neural Network in PyTorch and TensorFlow

Let’s compare how we declare the neural network in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In PyTorch, your neural network will be a class and using torch.nn package we import the necessary layers that are needed to build your architecture. All the layers are first declared in the __init__() method, and then in the forward() method we define how input x is traversed to all the layers in the network. Lastly, we declare a variable model and assign it to the defined architecture (model  = NeuralNet()).

Keras, a neural network framework which uses TensorFlow as the backend, is merged into TF Repository, meaning the syntax of declaring layers in TensorFlow is similar to the syntax of Keras. First, we declare the variable and assign it to the type of architecture we will be declaring, in this case a “Sequential()” architecture. Next, we directly add layers in a sequential manner using the model.add() method. The type of layer can be imported from tf.layers as shown in the code snippet below.

 

What Can Be Built With PyTorch vs. TensorFlow?

Initially, neural networks were used to solve simple classification problems like handwritten digit recognition or identifying a car’s registration number using cameras. But thanks to the latest frameworks and NVIDIA’s high computational graphics processing units (GPU’s), we can train neural networks on terabytes of data and solve far more complex problems. A few notable achievements include reaching state of the art performance on the IMAGENET dataset using convolutional neural networks implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The trained model can be used in different applications, such as object detection, image semantic segmentation and more.

Although the architecture of a neural network can be implemented on any of these frameworks, the result will not be the same. The training process has a lot of parameters that are framework dependent. For example, if you are training a dataset on PyTorch you can enhance the training process using GPU’s as they run on CUDA (a C++ backend). In TensorFlow you can access GPU’s but it uses its own inbuilt GPU acceleration, so the time to train these models will always vary based on the framework you choose.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: My Recommendation

TensorFlow is a very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. PyTorch, on the other hand, is still a relatively young framework with stronger community movement and it’s more Python-friendly.

What I would recommend is if you want to make things faster and build AI-related products, TensorFlow is a good choice. PyTorch is mostly recommended for research-oriented developers as it supports fast and dynamic training.

The key difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the way they execute code. Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type tensor. You can imagine a tensor as a multidimensional array shown in the below picture:

 

1. Mechanism: Dynamic vs. Static Graph Definition

TensorFlow is a framework composed of two core building blocks:

A library for defining computational graphs and runtime for executing such graphs on a variety of different hardware.
A computational graph which has many advantages (but more on that in just a moment).

A computational graph is an abstract way of describing computations as a directed graph. A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. It’s a set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

When you run code in TensorFlow, the computation graphs are defined statically. All communication with the outer world is performed via tf.Session object and tf.Placeholder, which are tensors that will be substituted by external data at runtime. For example, consider the following code snippet. 

This is how a computational graph is generated in a static way before the code is run in TensorFlow. The core advantage of having a computational graph is allowing parallelism or dependency driving scheduling which makes training faster and more efficient.

Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch has two core building blocks: 

Imperative and dynamic building of computational graphs.
Autograds: Performs automatic differentiation of the dynamic graphs.

As you can see in the animation below, the graphs change and execute nodes as you go with no special session interfaces or placeholders. Overall, the framework is more tightly integrated with the Python language and feels more native most of the time. Hence, PyTorch is more of a Pythonic framework and TensorFlow feels like a completely new language.

These differ a lot in the software fields based on the framework you use. TensorFlow provides a way of implementing dynamic graphs using a library called TensorFlow Fold, but PyTorch has it inbuilt.

2. Distributed Training

One main feature that distinguishes PyTorch from TensorFlow is data parallelism. PyTorch optimizes performance by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution from Python. In TensorFlow, you’ll have to manually code and fine tune every operation to be run on a specific device to allow distributed training. However, you can replicate everything in TensorFlow from PyTorch but you need to put in more effort. Below is the code snippet explaining how simple it is to implement distributed training for a model in PyTorch.

3. Visualization

When it comes to visualization of the training process, TensorFlow takes the lead. Data visualization helps the developer track the training process and debug in a more convenient way. TensorFlow’s visualization library is called TensorBoard. PyTorch developers use Visdom, however, the features provided by Visdom are very minimalistic and limited, so TensorBoard scores a point in visualizing the training process.

Features of TensorBoard
Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Visualizing the computational graph (ops and layers).
Viewing histograms of weights, biases or other tensors as they change over time.
Displaying images, text and audio data.
Profiling TensorFlow programs.
Visualizing training in TensorBoard.
Features of Visdom 
Handling callbacks.
Plotting graphs and details.
Managing environments.
Visualizing training in Visdom.
4. Production Deployment

When it comes to deploying trained models to production, TensorFlow is the clear winner. We can directly deploy models in TensorFlow using TensorFlow serving which is a framework that uses REST Client API.

In PyTorch, these production deployments became easier to handle than in its latest 1.0 stable version, but it doesn’t provide any framework to deploy models directly on to the web. You’ll have to use either Flask or Django as the backend server. So, TensorFlow serving may be a better option if performance is a concern.

5. Defining a Neural Network in PyTorch and TensorFlow

Let’s compare how we declare the neural network in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In PyTorch, your neural network will be a class and using torch.nn package we import the necessary layers that are needed to build your architecture. All the layers are first declared in the __init__() method, and then in the forward() method we define how input x is traversed to all the layers in the network. Lastly, we declare a variable model and assign it to the defined architecture (model  = NeuralNet()).

Keras, a neural network framework which uses TensorFlow as the backend, is merged into TF Repository, meaning the syntax of declaring layers in TensorFlow is similar to the syntax of Keras. First, we declare the variable and assign it to the type of architecture we will be declaring, in this case a “Sequential()” architecture. Next, we directly add layers in a sequential manner using the model.add() method. The type of layer can be imported from tf.layers as shown in the code snippet below.

 

What Can Be Built With PyTorch vs. TensorFlow?

Initially, neural networks were used to solve simple classification problems like handwritten digit recognition or identifying a car’s registration number using cameras. But thanks to the latest frameworks and NVIDIA’s high computational graphics processing units (GPU’s), we can train neural networks on terabytes of data and solve far more complex problems. A few notable achievements include reaching state of the art performance on the IMAGENET dataset using convolutional neural networks implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The trained model can be used in different applications, such as object detection, image semantic segmentation and more.

Although the architecture of a neural network can be implemented on any of these frameworks, the result will not be the same. The training process has a lot of parameters that are framework dependent. For example, if you are training a dataset on PyTorch you can enhance the training process using GPU’s as they run on CUDA (a C++ backend). In TensorFlow you can access GPU’s but it uses its own inbuilt GPU acceleration, so the time to train these models will always vary based on the framework you choose.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: My Recommendation

TensorFlow is a very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. PyTorch, on the other hand, is still a relatively young framework with stronger community movement and it’s more Python-friendly.

What I would recommend is if you want to make things faster and build AI-related products, TensorFlow is a good choice. PyTorch is mostly recommended for research-oriented developers as it supports fast and dynamic training.

What’s Next With TensorFlow vs. Pytorch?

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be state-of-the-art in many cases of supervised learning, but programming an ANN manually can be a challenging task. As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.

With the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.

Using artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.

Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.

The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.

TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.

Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.

TensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.

TensorFlow Advantages
Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.
Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.
Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.
Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).
Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.
Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.
Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.

TensorFlow Disadvantages
Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.
Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.
Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.
GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.
TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
PyTorch Overview

PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.

The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.

PyTorch 2.0

PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.

For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.

Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.

PyTorch Advantages
PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.
Easier to learn.  Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.
Debugging. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).
Dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
Data parallelism. The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores. Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.
Community. PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.
Distributed Training. PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.
PyTorch Disadvantages
Lacks model serving in production. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.
Limited monitoring and visualization interfaces. While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.
Not as extensive as TensorFlow. PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

 

Comparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
1.) Performance Comparison

The following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.

The table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.

2.) Accuracy

The PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.

The validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.

3.) Training Time and Memory Usage

The above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).

While the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.

The memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.

4.) Ease of Use

PyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.

On the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.

Moreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.

 

Differences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary

The answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.

In general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.

PyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.

TensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.

Another major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.

This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.\nArchitectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate.

Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.\nSymbolic loops.\xa0TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.\nGPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.\nTensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.\nPyTorch Overview\n\nPyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.\n\nThe open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks.

PyTorch and TensorFlow are two popular software frameworks used for building machine learning and deep learning models.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
PyTorch is a relatively young deep learning framework that is more Python-friendly and ideal for research, prototyping and dynamic projects.
TensorFlow is a mature deep learning framework with strong visualization capabilities and several options for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms.

Deep learning seeks to develop human-like computers to solve real-world problems, all by using special brain-like architectures called artificial neural networks. To help develop these architectures, tech giants like Meta and Google have released various frameworks for the Python deep learning environment, making it easier to learn, build and train diversified neural networks.

In this article, we’ll compare two widely used deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow.

 

What Is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that supports Python, C++ and Java. It is commonly used to develop machine learning models for computer vision, natural language processing and other deep learning tasks. PyTorch was created by the team at Meta AI and open sourced on GitHub in 2017. 

PyTorch has gained popularity for its simplicity, ease of use, dynamic computational graph and efficient memory usage, which we’ll discuss in more detail later.

 

What Is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework for Python, C++, Java and JavaScript. It can be used to build machine learning models for a range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing and task automation. TensorFlow was created by developers at Google and released in 2015. 

TensorFlow is widely applied by companies to develop and automate new systems. It draws its reputation from its distributed training support, scalable production and deployment options, and support for various devices like Android.

Difference Between PyTorch vs. TensorFlow

The key difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the way they execute code. Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type tensor. You can imagine a tensor as a multidimensional array shown in the below picture:

 

1. Mechanism: Dynamic vs. Static Graph Definition

TensorFlow is a framework composed of two core building blocks:

A library for defining computational graphs and runtime for executing such graphs on a variety of different hardware.
A computational graph which has many advantages (but more on that in just a moment).

A computational graph is an abstract way of describing computations as a directed graph. A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. It’s a set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

When you run code in TensorFlow, the computation graphs are defined statically. All communication with the outer world is performed via tf.Session object and tf.Placeholder, which are tensors that will be substituted by external data at runtime. For example, consider the following code snippet. 

This is how a computational graph is generated in a static way before the code is run in TensorFlow. The core advantage of having a computational graph is allowing parallelism or dependency driving scheduling which makes training faster and more efficient.

Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch has two core building blocks: 

Imperative and dynamic building of computational graphs.
Autograds: Performs automatic differentiation of the dynamic graphs.

As you can see in the animation below, the graphs change and execute nodes as you go with no special session interfaces or placeholders. Overall, the framework is more tightly integrated with the Python language and feels more native most of the time. Hence, PyTorch is more of a Pythonic framework and TensorFlow feels like a completely new language.

These differ a lot in the software fields based on the framework you use. TensorFlow provides a way of implementing dynamic graphs using a library called TensorFlow Fold, but PyTorch has it inbuilt.

2. Distributed Training

One main feature that distinguishes PyTorch from TensorFlow is data parallelism. PyTorch optimizes performance by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution from Python. In TensorFlow, you’ll have to manually code and fine tune every operation to be run on a specific device to allow distributed training. However, you can replicate everything in TensorFlow from PyTorch but you need to put in more effort. Below is the code snippet explaining how simple it is to implement distributed training for a model in PyTorch.

3. Visualization

When it comes to visualization of the training process, TensorFlow takes the lead. Data visualization helps the developer track the training process and debug in a more convenient way. TensorFlow’s visualization library is called TensorBoard. PyTorch developers use Visdom, however, the features provided by Visdom are very minimalistic and limited, so TensorBoard scores a point in visualizing the training process.

Features of TensorBoard
Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Visualizing the computational graph (ops and layers).
Viewing histograms of weights, biases or other tensors as they change over time.
Displaying images, text and audio data.
Profiling TensorFlow programs.
Visualizing training in TensorBoard.
Features of Visdom 
Handling callbacks.
Plotting graphs and details.
Managing environments.
Visualizing training in Visdom.
4. Production Deployment

When it comes to deploying trained models to production, TensorFlow is the clear winner. We can directly deploy models in TensorFlow using TensorFlow serving which is a framework that uses REST Client API.

In PyTorch, these production deployments became easier to handle than in its latest 1.0 stable version, but it doesn’t provide any framework to deploy models directly on to the web. You’ll have to use either Flask or Django as the backend server. So, TensorFlow serving may be a better option if performance is a concern.

5. Defining a Neural Network in PyTorch and TensorFlow

Let’s compare how we declare the neural network in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In PyTorch, your neural network will be a class and using torch.nn package we import the necessary layers that are needed to build your architecture. All the layers are first declared in the __init__() method, and then in the forward() method we define how input x is traversed to all the layers in the network. Lastly, we declare a variable model and assign it to the defined architecture (model  = NeuralNet()).

Keras, a neural network framework which uses TensorFlow as the backend, is merged into TF Repository, meaning the syntax of declaring layers in TensorFlow is similar to the syntax of Keras. First, we declare the variable and assign it to the type of architecture we will be declaring, in this case a “Sequential()” architecture. Next, we directly add layers in a sequential manner using the model.add() method. The type of layer can be imported from tf.layers as shown in the code snippet below.

 

What Can Be Built With PyTorch vs. TensorFlow?

Initially, neural networks were used to solve simple classification problems like handwritten digit recognition or identifying a car’s registration number using cameras. But thanks to the latest frameworks and NVIDIA’s high computational graphics processing units (GPU’s), we can train neural networks on terabytes of data and solve far more complex problems. A few notable achievements include reaching state of the art performance on the IMAGENET dataset using convolutional neural networks implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The trained model can be used in different applications, such as object detection, image semantic segmentation and more.

Although the architecture of a neural network can be implemented on any of these frameworks, the result will not be the same. The training process has a lot of parameters that are framework dependent. For example, if you are training a dataset on PyTorch you can enhance the training process using GPU’s as they run on CUDA (a C++ backend). In TensorFlow you can access GPU’s but it uses its own inbuilt GPU acceleration, so the time to train these models will always vary based on the framework you choose.

PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: My Recommendation

TensorFlow is a very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. PyTorch, on the other hand, is still a relatively young framework with stronger community movement and it’s more Python-friendly.

What I would recommend is if you want to make things faster and build AI-related products, TensorFlow is a good choice. PyTorch is mostly recommended for research-oriented developers as it supports fast and dynamic training.

Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type tensor. You can imagine a tensor as a multidimensional array shown in the below picture:\n\n\xa0\n\n1. Mechanism: Dynamic vs. Static Graph Definition\n\nTensorFlow is a framework composed of two core building blocks:\n\nA library for defining computational graphs and runtime for executing such graphs on a variety of different hardware.\nA computational graph which has many advantages (but more on that in just a moment).\n\nA computational graph is an abstract way of describing computations as a directed graph. A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. It’s a set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.\n\nWhen you run code in TensorFlow, the computation graphs are defined statically. All communication with the outer world is performed via tf.Session object and tf.Placeholder, which are tensors that will be substituted by external data at runtime. For example, consider the following code snippet.\xa0\n\nThis is how a computational graph is generated in a static way before the code is run in TensorFlow. The core advantage of having a computational graph is allowing parallelism or dependency driving scheduling which makes training faster and more efficient.\n\nSimilar to TensorFlow, PyTorch has two core building blocks:\xa0\n\nImperative and dynamic building of computational graphs.\nAutograds: Performs automatic differentiation of the dynamic graphs.\n\nAs you can see in the animation below, the graphs change and execute nodes as you go with no special session interfaces or placeholders. Overall, the framework is more tightly integrated with the Python language and feels more native most of the time. Hence, PyTorch is more of a Pythonic framework and TensorFlow feels like a completely new language.\n\nThese differ a lot in the software fields based on the framework you use.

As technology is evolving rapidly today, both Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning are imbibed in most business operations and have proved to be quite integral. Deep learning is a machine learning type based on ANN. For many applications, shallow machine learning models and traditional data analysis approaches fail to reach the performance of deep learning models. 

Deep learning (DL) frameworks offer the building blocks for designing, training, and validating deep neural networks through a high-level programming interface. These frameworks provide superior performance and better management of dependencies. 

Today, let's discuss the key differences between PyTorch vs TensorFlow. We have numerous frameworks at our disposal that allow us to develop compact and robust tools that can offer a better abstraction and simplify difficult programming challenges.

What is PyTorch? 

From the definition as per the official website, PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. It is a development tool that removes cognitive overhead involved in building, training and deploying neural networks.  

The PyTorch framework runs on Python and is based on the Torch library (Lua-based deep learning framework). Adam Paszke, Sam Gross, Soumith Chintala, and Gregory Chanan authored PyTorch, and Meta AI primarily develops it. Given the PyTorch framework’s architectural style, one can tell the entire deep modeling process is far more transparent and straightforward when compared with Torch. 

What is TensorFlow? 

As per the definition from the official website, TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow is by far one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. It is developed by Google Brain and supports languages like Python, C++ and R.  

TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to process data. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. As you build these neural networks, you can look at how the data flows through the neural network.   

Difference Between TensorFlow and PyTorch: Detailed Comparison 

TensorFlow and PyTorch are inarguably the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. Though both are open-source libraries, it might not be easy to figure out the difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow. Both frameworks are extensively used by data scientists, ML engineers, researchers and developers in commercial code and academic research.    

Both frameworks work on the fundamental data type called a tensor. A tensor is a multidimensional array, as shown in the below picture. 

Source: tensorflow.org 

There has always been a contentious debate over which framework is superior, with each camp having its share of ardent supporters. The debate landscape is ever evolving as PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed quickly over their relatively short lifetimes. It is important to note that since incomplete or outdated information is abundant, the conversation about which framework reigns premier is much more nuanced as of 2024 - let’s explore these differences in detail.  

Just to show you a broad picture of growth in usage and demand of TensorFlow and PyTorch deep learning frameworks, Google's worldwide trend graph for the search keywords TensorFlow vs. PyTorch across the last 5 years is as below:

 

Google search trends

1. PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Performance Comparison 

Even though both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide similar fast performance when it comes to speed, both frameworks have advantages and disadvantages in specific scenarios.   

The performance of Python is faster for PyTorch. Despite that, due to TensorFlow’s greater support for symbolic manipulation that allows users to perform higher-level operations, programming models can be less flexible in PyTorch as compared to TensorFlow. 

In general, for most cases, because of its ability to take advantage of any GPU(s) connected to your system, TensorFlow should ideally provide better performance than PyTorch. Training deep learning models using Autograd that require significantly less memory is one of the exceptions where PyTorch performs better than TensorFlow in terms of training times.   

The following benchmark shows that TensorFlow exhibits better training performance on CNN models, while PyTorch is better on BERT and RNN models (except for GNMT). Looking at the difference % column, it is noticeable that the performance between TensorFlow and PyTorch is very close. 

2. PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Training Time and Memory Usage 

For PyTorch and TensorFlow, time taken for training and memory usage vary based on the dataset used for training, device type and neural network architecture.    

We can observe from the diagram below that the training time for PyTorch is significantly higher than TensorFlow on the CPU.

From the below diagram, we can see that for CNN architecture training time for PyTorch is significantly higher than TensorFlow on GPU. But, for LSTM architecture, except for “Many things” dataset, training time for PyTorch is significantly lower than TensorFlow on GPU.

As we can see from the following diagram, memory consumption is slightly higher for PyTorch on CPU compared to that of TensorFlow. 

And as we can see from the following diagram, memory consumption is significantly higher for TensorFlow on GPU compared to that of PyTorch.
 

 3. PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Accuracy 

For a good number of models, the best possible accuracy attained during training can be the same for PyTorch and TensorFlow for a given model. But hyperparameters used could be different between these frameworks including parameters such as number of epochs, training time, etc. From the below diagram, we can see that the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. 

 

In Spite of all sorts of hyperparameter tuning, the best possible accuracy achieved could differ between PyTorch and TensorFlow, and one might beat another one in accuracy - for a given dataset (CIFAR, MNIST, etc.), device (CPU, GPU, TPU etc.), type of neural network (CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.), type of CNN (Faster R-CNN, Efficientnet, etc.). These differences arise due to various reasons including optimization methods, backend libraries used, computation methods used, etc.

From the below diagram, we can see that for MNIST, both TensorFlow and PyTorch achieve an accuracy of ~98%. While for CIFAR-10, TensorFlow achieved an accuracy of ~80%, but PyTorch could get ~72% only. For CIFAR-100, PyTorch archives ~48% but TensorFlow could score ~42% only, whereas Keras gets ~54%. 

For the below diagram, we can observe that PyTorch experiences a significant performance jump after the 30th epochs to reach a peak accuracy of 51.4% at the 48th epochs, while TensorFlow achieves peak accuracy of 63% at the 40th epochs. 

4. PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Debugging 

As PyTorch uses a standard python debugger, the user does not need to learn another debugger. Since PyTorch uses immediate execution (i.e., eager mode), it is said to be easier to use than TensorFlow when it comes to debugging. Hence in the case of PyTorch, you can use Python debugging tools such as PDB, ipdb, and PyCharm debugger.  

For TensorFlow, there are two ways to go about debugging: you must request the variables from the session or learn the TF debugger. Either way, TensorFlow requires you to execute your code before you can debug it explicitly. You must write code for the nodes in your graph to be able to run your program in debug mode. To find the problems related to memory allocation or errors at runtime that require more advanced debugging features such as stack traces and watches, you’ll have to use TF debugger). 

5. PyTorch versus TensorFlow: Mechanism: Graph Definition 

As TensorFlow works on a static graph concept, the user must first define the computation graph and then run the machine learning model. So basically, TensorFlow has its graphs pre-constructed at the beginning of training. Next, the graph must go through compilation, executing computations against these graphs.   

PyTorch gives an edge with its dynamic computational graph construction, which means the graph is constructed as the operations are executed. The main advantage of this approach is that - graphs can be less complex than those in other frameworks since graphs are built on demand (i.e., graphs are built by interpreting the line of code corresponding to that particular aspect of the graph). Since data doesn't need to be passed around to intermediate nodes when it's not required, complexity can be reduced here. 

Advantages and Disadvantages of TensorFlow 
Advantages 
Data Visualization: TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard that helps with the graphical visualization of data. By reducing the effort of looking at the whole code, the tool facilitates easy node debugging and effectively helps with an easy resolution of the neural network. The tool lets you see and observe multiple aspects of the machine learning model, such as the model graph and loss curve. 
Compatibility: TensorFlow is compatible with many programming languages. It provides a stable Python API and APIs without a backward compatibility guarantee for languages such as Javascript, C++, and Java. It provides third-party language binding packages for C#, Haskell, Julia, MATLAB, R, Scala, Rust, OCaml, and Crystal.  
Scalability: The scalability offered by TensorFlow is high as it was built to be production-ready and can easily handle large datasets.  
Architectural Support: The TensorFlow architecture uses an application-specific AI accelerator called TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), which offers faster computation than that of GPUs and CPUs. Deep learning models built on top of TPUs can be easily deployed over clouds, and they work faster than the other two.  
Model Building: Using intuitive high-level APIs such as Keras, the TensorFlow library allows us to build and train machine learning models with quick model iteration and easy debugging.   
Deployment: Since its inception, it has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications. TensorFlow, equipped with the arsenal of associated tools, makes the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, robust tools such as TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.  
ML Production: We can train and deploy the models in the cloud, on-premises, in the browser, or on a device, irrespective of the language the user makes use of.  
Open Source: Any user can employ the TensorFlow module whenever and wherever required, as it is free of cost to anyone who wants to work with it or utilize it.  
Integration and EcoSystem: TensorFlow can easily integrate with Google’s services if you use Google Cloud. For example, saving a TF Lite model onto its Firestore account and delivering the model to a mobile application. Another example is the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices, a must-have for many industries.  
Disadvantages 
Backward Compatibility: The life of researchers is difficult with TensorFlow as there are backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2.  
Training Loops: In TensorFlow, the procedure to create training loops is slightly complex and not very intuitive.  
Frequent Updates: As TensorFlow gets updates very often, it becomes overhead for a user to maintain the project as it involves uninstallation and reinstallation from time to time so that it can bind and be blended with its latest updates.  
Symbolic Loops: TensorFlow lags at providing symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. Its support for definite sequences makes it a useful resource.   
Inconsistency: TensorFlow’s contents include some homonyms as names, making it difficult for users to remember to use them. Since the same name gets used for various purposes, it can get confusing more often.  
Computation Speed: Benchmark tests show that TensorFlow lags in computation speed compared to its competitors. Also, it has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.  
Advantages and Disadvantages of PyTorch 
Advantages 
Pythonic in Nature: Most of the code deployed in PyTorch is pythonic, which means the procedural coding is similar to most of the elements of Python. PyTorch smoothly integrates with the python data science stack. PyTorch functionalities can easily be implemented with other libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, and Cython.  
Ease of Use and Flexibility: PyTorch is very simple and provides easy-to-use APIs. PyTorch is constructed in a way that is intuitive to understand and easy to develop machine learning projects.  
Easier to Learn: PyTorch is relatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks, as its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python.  
Dynamic Computation Graph: PyTorch supports Dynamic Graphs. This feature is especially useful for changing the network behavior programmatically at runtime. When you cannot pre-determine the allocation of memory or other details for the particular computation, dynamically created graphs are most useful.  
Documentation: PyTorch’s documentation is very organized and helpful for beginners, and it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases. PyTorch has one of the best documentations that is helpful to get a hold of a majority of the essential concepts. They have a detailed description where one can understand most of the core topics such as torch.Tensor, torch.autograd, Tensor Attributes, Tensor Views, and so much more. 
Model Availability: Since PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape and the community has widely adopted it, most publications/available models use PyTorch.  
Community Support: PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.PyTorch.org). Apart from the default documentation, the entire community highly supports PyTorch and related projects. Working, sharing, and developing PyTorch projects is easier while working on a research project. 
Disadvantages 
Visualization Techniques: PyTorch does not have as great an option for visualization, and developers can connect externally to TensorBoard or use one of the existing Python data visualization tools.  
Model Serving in Production: For PyTorch serving, even though we have TorchServe, which is easy to use and flexible, it does not have the same compactness as its TensorFlow counterpart. In terms of serving in production, PyTorch has a long way to go before it can compete with the superior deployment tool. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work.  
Not as extensive as TensorFlow: The development of actual applications might involve converting the PyTorch code or model into another framework, as PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool. 
Which is Better in 2024: PyTorch or TensorFlow? 

The debate on PyTorch vs. TensorFlow doesn't have a definitive answer. Each framework is superior for specific use cases. Both are state-of-the-art, but they have key distinctions. PyTorch supports dynamic computation graphs and is generally easier to use. TensorFlow is more mature with extensive libraries but may require more learning time.

Decide based on your project needs. For quick learning and ease of use, PyTorch is preferable. For production-ready frameworks supporting heavy calculations, TensorFlow may be ideal.

1. For a Researcher 

PyTorch is the de facto research framework with most SOTA models. It offers features essential for research, like GPU capabilities, an easy API, scalability, and excellent debugging tools. However, in Reinforcement Learning (RL), TensorFlow might be better due to its native agents' library and DeepMind’s Acme.

2. For an Industry Professional 

For deep learning engineering in industry, TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end platform are invaluable, though it requires more learning. If accessing SOTA models in PyTorch, consider using TorchServe. For deploying PyTorch models within TensorFlow workflows, ONNX might be needed. For IoT or embedded systems, use TensorFlow with the TFLite + Coral pipeline. For mobile applications, prefer PyTorch unless you need video or audio input, then use TensorFlow.

3. For a Beginner 

Beginners should start with Keras (part of TensorFlow) or FastAI (for PyTorch) to quickly learn Deep Learning basics. As you advance, choose based on the discussed points. 

Conclusion

As both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their merits, declaring one framework as a clear winner is always a tough choice. Picking TensorFlow or PyTorch will come down to one’s skill and needs. Overall, both frameworks offer great speed and come equipped with strong Python APIs. 

As of 2024, both TensorFlow and PyTorch are very mature and stable frameworks, and there is a significant and visible overlap with their core Deep Learning features. Today, the practical considerations of each framework supersede their technical differences. These considerations include time to deploy, model availability, associated ecosystems, etc.  

Both frameworks have good documentation, active communities, and many learning resources, so you’re not making a mistake choosing either framework. While TensorFlow remains the go-to industry framework, and after its explosive adoption by the research community, PyTorch has become the go-to research framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.

It is a development tool that removes cognitive overhead involved in building, training and deploying neural networks.\xa0\xa0\n\nThe\xa0PyTorch\xa0framework runs on Python and is based on the Torch library (Lua-based deep learning framework). Adam\xa0Paszke, Sam Gross, Soumith Chintala, and Gregory Chanan authored\xa0PyTorch, and Meta AI primarily develops it. Given the\xa0PyTorch\xa0framework’s architectural style, one can tell the entire deep modeling process is far more transparent and straightforward when compared with Torch.\xa0\n\nWhat is\xa0TensorFlow?\xa0\n\nAs per the definition from the official\xa0website,\xa0TensorFlow\xa0is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow is by far one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. It is developed by Google Brain and supports languages like Python, C++ and R.\xa0\xa0\n\nTensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to process data. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. As you build these neural networks, you can look at how the data flows through the neural network. \xa0\xa0\n\nDifference Between\xa0TensorFlow\xa0and\xa0PyTorch: Detailed Comparison\xa0\n\nTensorFlow and PyTorch are inarguably the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. Though both are open-source libraries, it might not be easy to figure out the difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow. Both frameworks are extensively used by data scientists, ML engineers, researchers and developers in commercial code and academic research. \xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nBoth frameworks work on the fundamental data type called a tensor. A tensor is a multidimensional array, as shown in the below picture.\xa0\n\nSource: tensorflow.org\xa0\n\nThere has always been a contentious debate over which framework is superior, with each camp having its share of ardent supporters. The debate landscape is ever evolving as PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed quickly over their relatively short lifetimes. It is important to note that since incomplete or outdated information is abundant, the conversation about which framework reigns premier is much more nuanced as of 2024 - let’s explore these differences in detail.\xa0\xa0\n\nJust to show you a broad picture of growth in usage and demand of\xa0TensorFlow\xa0and\xa0PyTorch\xa0deep learning frameworks, Google\'s worldwide trend graph for the search keywords\xa0TensorFlow\xa0vs.\xa0PyTorch\xa0across the last 5 years is as below:\n\n\xa0\n\nGoogle search trends\n\n1. PyTorch\xa0vs\xa0TensorFlow:\xa0Performance Comparison\xa0\n\nEven though both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide similar fast performance when it comes to speed, both frameworks have advantages and disadvantages in specific scenarios. \xa0\xa0\n\nThe performance of Python is faster for\xa0PyTorch. Despite that, due to\xa0TensorFlow’s greater support for symbolic manipulation that allows users to perform higher-level operations, programming models can be less flexible in\xa0PyTorch\xa0as compared to\xa0TensorFlow.\xa0\n\nIn general, for most cases, because of its ability to take advantage of any GPU(s) connected to your system, TensorFlow should ideally provide better performance than PyTorch. Training deep learning models using Autograd that require significantly less memory is one of the exceptions where PyTorch performs better than TensorFlow in terms of training times. \xa0\xa0\n\nThe following benchmark shows that TensorFlow exhibits better training performance on CNN models, while PyTorch is better on BERT and RNN models (except for GNMT). Looking at the difference % column, it is noticeable that the performance between TensorFlow and PyTorch is very close.\xa0\n\n2. PyTorch\xa0vs\xa0TensorFlow:\xa0Training Time and Memory Usage\xa0\n\nFor PyTorch and TensorFlow, time taken for training and memory usage vary based on the dataset used for training, device type and neural network architecture.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nWe can observe from the diagram below that the training time for PyTorch is significantly higher than TensorFlow on the CPU.\n\nSource\n\nFrom the below diagram, we can see that for CNN architecture training time for PyTorch is significantly higher than TensorFlow on GPU. But, for LSTM architecture, except for “Many things” dataset, training time for PyTorch is significantly lower than TensorFlow on GPU.\n\nAs we can see from the following diagram, memory consumption is slightly higher for PyTorch on CPU compared to that of TensorFlow.\xa0\n\nAnd as we can see from the following diagram, memory consumption is significantly higher for TensorFlow on GPU compared to that of PyTorch.\n\xa0\n\n\xa03. PyTorch\xa0vs\xa0TensorFlow:\xa0Accuracy\xa0\n\nFor a good number of models, the best possible accuracy attained during training can be the same for PyTorch and TensorFlow for a given model. But hyperparameters used could be different between these frameworks including parameters such as number of epochs, training time, etc. From the below diagram, we can see that the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs.\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nIn Spite of all sorts of hyperparameter tuning, the best possible accuracy achieved could differ between PyTorch and TensorFlow, and one might beat another one in accuracy - for a given dataset (CIFAR, MNIST, etc.), device (CPU, GPU, TPU etc.),\xa0type of neural network\xa0(CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.), type of CNN (Faster R-CNN, Efficientnet, etc.). These differences arise due to various reasons including optimization methods, backend libraries used, computation methods used, etc.\n\nFrom the below diagram, we can see that for MNIST, both TensorFlow and PyTorch achieve an accuracy of ~98%. While for CIFAR-10, TensorFlow achieved an accuracy of ~80%, but PyTorch could get ~72% only. For CIFAR-100, PyTorch archives ~48% but TensorFlow could score ~42% only, whereas Keras gets ~54%.\xa0\n\nFor the below diagram, we can observe that\xa0PyTorch\xa0experiences a significant performance jump after the 30th epochs to reach a peak accuracy of 51.4% at the 48th epochs, while\xa0TensorFlow\xa0achieves peak accuracy of 63% at the 40th epochs.\xa0\n\n4. PyTorch\xa0vs\xa0TensorFlow:\xa0Debugging\xa0\n\nAs PyTorch uses a standard python debugger, the user does not need to learn another debugger.

Since data doesn\'t need to be passed around to intermediate nodes when it\'s not required, complexity can be reduced here.\xa0\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of\xa0TensorFlow\xa0\nAdvantages\xa0\nData Visualization:\xa0TensorFlow provides a tool called\xa0TensorBoard\xa0that helps with the graphical visualization of data. By reducing the effort of looking at the whole code, the tool facilitates easy node debugging and effectively helps with an easy resolution of the neural network. The tool lets you see and observe multiple aspects of the machine learning model, such as the model graph and loss curve.\xa0\nCompatibility:\xa0TensorFlow is compatible with many programming languages. It provides a stable Python API and APIs without a backward compatibility guarantee for languages such as Javascript, C++, and Java. It provides third-party language binding packages for C#, Haskell, Julia, MATLAB, R, Scala, Rust, OCaml, and Crystal.\xa0\xa0\nScalability:\xa0The scalability offered by TensorFlow is high as it was built to be production-ready and can easily handle large datasets.\xa0\xa0\nArchitectural Support:\xa0The TensorFlow architecture uses an application-specific AI accelerator called TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), which offers faster computation than that of GPUs and CPUs. Deep learning models built on top of TPUs can be easily deployed over clouds, and they work faster than the other two.\xa0\xa0\nModel Building:\xa0Using intuitive high-level APIs such as Keras, the TensorFlow library allows us to build and train machine learning models with quick model iteration and easy debugging. \xa0\xa0\nDeployment:\xa0Since its inception, it has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications. TensorFlow, equipped with the arsenal of associated tools, makes the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, robust tools such as TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.\xa0\xa0\nML Production:\xa0We can train and deploy the models in the cloud, on-premises, in the browser, or on a device, irrespective of the language the user makes use of.\xa0\xa0\nOpen Source:\xa0Any user can employ the TensorFlow module whenever and wherever required, as it is free of cost to anyone who wants to work with it or utilize it.\xa0\xa0\nIntegration and EcoSystem:\xa0TensorFlow can easily integrate with Google’s services if you use Google Cloud. For example, saving a TF Lite model onto its Firestore account and delivering the model to a mobile application. Another example is the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices, a must-have for many industries.\xa0\xa0\nDisadvantages\xa0\nBackward Compatibility:\xa0The life of researchers is difficult with TensorFlow as there are backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2.\xa0\xa0\nTraining Loops:\xa0In TensorFlow, the procedure to create training loops is slightly complex and not very intuitive.\xa0\xa0\nFrequent Updates:\xa0As TensorFlow gets updates very often, it becomes overhead for a user to maintain the project as it involves uninstallation and reinstallation from time to time so that it can bind and be blended with its latest updates.\xa0\xa0\nSymbolic Loops: TensorFlow lags at providing symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. Its support for definite sequences makes it a useful resource. \xa0\xa0\nInconsistency:\xa0TensorFlow’s contents include some homonyms as names, making it difficult for users to remember to use them. Since the same name gets used for various purposes, it can get confusing more often.\xa0\xa0\nComputation Speed:\xa0Benchmark tests show that TensorFlow lags in computation speed compared to its competitors. Also, it has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.\xa0\xa0\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of\xa0PyTorch\xa0\nAdvantages\xa0\nPythonic in Nature:\xa0Most of the code deployed in PyTorch is pythonic, which means the procedural coding is similar to most of the elements of Python. PyTorch smoothly integrates with the python data science stack. PyTorch functionalities can easily be implemented with other libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, and Cython.\xa0\xa0\nEase of Use and Flexibility:\xa0PyTorch is very simple and provides easy-to-use APIs. PyTorch is constructed in a way that is intuitive to understand and easy to develop machine learning projects.\xa0\xa0\nEasier to Learn:\xa0PyTorch is relatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks, as its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python.\xa0\xa0\nDynamic Computation Graph:\xa0PyTorch supports Dynamic Graphs. This feature is especially useful for changing the network behavior programmatically at runtime. When you cannot pre-determine the allocation of memory or other details for the particular computation, dynamically created graphs are most useful.\xa0\xa0\nDocumentation:\xa0PyTorch’s documentation is very organized and helpful for beginners, and it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases. PyTorch has one of the best documentations that is helpful to get a hold of a majority of the essential concepts. They have a detailed description where one can understand most of the core topics such as torch.Tensor, torch.autograd, Tensor Attributes, Tensor Views, and so much more.\xa0\nModel Availability:\xa0Since PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape and the community has widely adopted it, most publications/available models use PyTorch.\xa0\xa0\nCommunity Support:\xa0PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.PyTorch.org). Apart from the default documentation, the entire community highly supports PyTorch and related projects. Working, sharing, and developing PyTorch projects is easier while working on a research project.\xa0\nDisadvantages\xa0\nVisualization Techniques: PyTorch does not have as great an option for visualization, and developers can connect externally to TensorBoard or use one of the existing Python data visualization tools.\xa0\xa0\nModel Serving in Production:\xa0For PyTorch serving, even though we have TorchServe, which is easy to use and flexible, it does not have the same compactness as its TensorFlow counterpart. In terms of serving in production, PyTorch has a long way to go before it can compete with the superior deployment tool. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work.\xa0\xa0\nNot as extensive as TensorFlow:\xa0The development of actual applications might involve converting the\xa0PyTorch\xa0code or model into another framework, as\xa0PyTorch\xa0is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool.\xa0\nWhich is Better in 2024:\xa0PyTorch\xa0or\xa0TensorFlow?\xa0\n\nThe debate on PyTorch vs. TensorFlow doesn\'t have a definitive answer. Each framework is superior for specific use cases. Both are state-of-the-art, but they have key distinctions. PyTorch supports dynamic computation graphs and is generally easier to use. TensorFlow is more mature with extensive libraries but may require more learning time.\n\nDecide based on your project needs. For quick learning and ease of use, PyTorch is preferable. For production-ready frameworks supporting heavy calculations, TensorFlow may be ideal.\n\n1.\xa0For a Researcher\xa0\n\nPyTorch is the de facto research framework with most SOTA models. It offers features essential for research, like GPU capabilities, an easy API, scalability, and excellent debugging tools. However, in Reinforcement Learning (RL), TensorFlow might be better due to its native agents\' library and DeepMind’s Acme.\n\n2.\xa0For\xa0an\xa0Industry Professional\xa0\n\nFor deep learning engineering in industry, TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end platform are invaluable, though it requires more learning. If accessing SOTA models in PyTorch, consider using TorchServe. For deploying PyTorch models within TensorFlow workflows, ONNX might be needed. For IoT or embedded systems, use TensorFlow with the TFLite + Coral pipeline. For mobile applications, prefer PyTorch unless you need video or audio input, then use TensorFlow.\n\n3.\xa0For a Beginner\xa0\n\nBeginners should start with Keras (part of TensorFlow) or FastAI (for PyTorch) to quickly learn Deep Learning basics. As you advance, choose based on the discussed points.\xa0\n\nConclusion\n\nAs both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their merits, declaring one framework as a clear winner is always a tough choice. Picking TensorFlow or PyTorch will come down to one’s skill and needs. Overall, both frameworks offer great speed and come equipped with strong Python APIs.\xa0\n\nAs of 2024, both TensorFlow and PyTorch are very mature and stable frameworks, and there is a significant and visible overlap with their core Deep Learning features. Today, the practical considerations of each framework supersede their technical differences. These considerations include time to deploy, model availability, associated ecosystems, etc.\xa0\xa0\n\nBoth frameworks have good documentation, active communities, and many learning resources, so you’re not making a mistake choosing either framework. While\xa0TensorFlow\xa0remains the go-to industry framework, and after its explosive adoption by the research community,\xa0PyTorch\xa0has become the go-to research framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.\xa0\n\nLearn Software Development Courses online from the World’s top Universities.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow in 2023

Should you use PyTorch vs TensorFlow in 2023? This guide walks through the major pros and cons of PyTorch vs TensorFlow, and how you can pick the right framework.

Ryan O'Connor

Senior Developer Educator

Dec 14, 2021

PyTorch and TensorFlow are far and away the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. The debate over which framework is superior is a longstanding point of contentious debate, with each camp having its share of fervent supporters.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed so quickly over their relatively short lifetimes that the debate landscape is ever-evolving. Outdated or incomplete information is abundant, and further obfuscates the complex discussion of which framework has the upper hand in a given domain.

While TensorFlow has a reputation for being an industry-focused framework and PyTorch has a reputation for being a research-focused framework, we’ll see that these notions stem partially from outdated information. The conversation about which framework reigns supreme is much more nuanced going into 2023 - let’s explore these differences now.

#
Practical Considerations

PyTorch and TensorFlow alike have unique development stories and complicated design-decision histories. Previously, this has made comparing the two a complicated technical discussion about their current features and speculated future features. Given that both frameworks have matured exponentially since their inceptions, many of these technical differences are vestigial at this point.

Luckily for those of us who don’t want their eyes glazing over, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate currently comes down to three practical considerations:

Model Availability: With the domain of Deep Learning expanding every year and models becoming bigger in turn, training State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models from scratch is simply not feasible anymore. There are fortunately many SOTA models publicly available, and it is important to utilize them where possible.
Deployment Infrastructure: Training well-performing models is pointless if they can’t be put to use. Lowering time-to-deploy is paramount, especially with the growing popularity of microservice business models; and efficient deployment has the potential to make-or-break many businesses that center on Machine Learning.
Ecosystems: No longer is Deep Learning relegated to specific use cases in highly controlled environments. AI is injecting new power into a litany of industries, so a framework that sits within a larger ecosystem which facilitates development for mobile, local, and server applications is important. Also, the advent of specialized Machine Learning hardware, such as Google’s Edge TPU, means that successful practitioners need to work with a framework that can integrate well with this hardware.

We’ll explore each of these three practical considerations in turn, and then provide our recommendations for which framework to use in different areas.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Model Availability

Implementing a successful Deep Learning model from scratch can be a very tricky task, especially for applications such as NLP where engineering and optimization are difficult. The growing complexity of SOTA models makes training and tuning simply impractical, approaching impossible, tasks for small-scale enterprises. Startups and researchers alike simply do not have the computational resources to utilize and explore such models on their own, so access to pre-trained models for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or out-of-the-box inference is invaluable.

In the arena of model availability, PyTorch and TensorFlow diverge sharply. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own official model repositories, as we’ll explore below in the Ecosystems section, but practitioners may want to utilize models from other sources. Let’s take a quantitative look at model availability for each framework.

HuggingFace

HuggingFace makes it possible to incorporate trained and tuned SOTA models into your pipelines in just a few lines of code.

When we compare HuggingFace model availability for PyTorch vs TensorFlow, the results are staggering. Below we see a chart of the total number of models available on HuggingFace that are either PyTorch or TensorFlow exclusive, or available for both frameworks. As we can see, the number of models available for use exclusively in PyTorch absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Almost 92% of models are PyTorch exclusive, up from 85% last year. In contrast, only about 8% being TensorFlow exclusive, with only about 14% of all models available for TensorFlow (down from 16% last year). Further, over 45 thousand PyTorch exclusive models were added in 2022, whereas only about 4 thousand TensorFlow exclusive models were added.

We see interesting results if we relegate our purview to only the 30 most popular models on HuggingFace. While all models are available in PyTorch and none are TensorFlow exclusive, like last year, the number of models available for both has increased from 19 to 23, indicating that there may be an effort for TensorFlow coverage on the most popular models.

Research Papers

For research practitioners especially, having access to models from recently-published papers is critical. Attempting to recreate new models that you want to explore in a different framework wastes valuable time, so being able to clone a repository and immediately start experimenting means that you can focus on the important work.

Given that PyTorch is the de facto research framework, we would expect the trend we observed on HuggingFace to continue into the research community as a whole; and our intuition is correct.

We’ve aggregated data from eight top research journals over the past several years into the below graph, which shows the relative proportion of publications that use PyTorch or TensorFlow. As you can see, the adoption of PyTorch was extremely rapid and, in just a few years, grew from use in just about 7% to use in almost 80% of papers that use either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Data source

Much of the reason for this rapid adoption was due to difficulties with TensorFlow 1 that were exacerbated in the context of research, leading researchers to look to the newer alternative PyTorch. While many of TensorFlow’s issues were addressed with the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, PyTorch’s momentum has been great enough for it to maintain itself as the established research-centric framework, at least from a community perspective.

We can see the same pattern if we look at the fraction of researchers who migrated frameworks. When we look at publications by authors that were using either PyTorch or TensorFlow in 2018 and 2019, we find that the majority of authors who used TensorFlow in 2018 migrated to PyTorch in 2019 (55%), while the vast majority of authors who used PyTorch in 2018 stayed with PyTorch 2019 (85%). This data is visualized in the Sankey diagram below, where the left side corresponds to 2018 and the right side to 2019. Note that the data represent proportions of users of each framework in 2018, not total numbers.

Data source

Careful readers will notice that this data is from before the release of TensorFlow 2, but as we will see in the next section, this fact is irrelevant in the research community.

Papers with Code

Lastly, we look at data from Papers with Code - a website whose mission it is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, datasets, etc. We’ve plotted the percentage of papers which utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, or another framework over time, with data aggregated quarterly, from late 2017 to the current quarter. We see the steady growth of papers utilizing PyTorch - out of the 3,319 repositories created this quarter, nearly 70% of them are implemented in PyTorch, with just 4% implemented in TensorFlow (down from 11% last year).

Conversely, we see the steady decline in use of TensorFlow. Even the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, which addressed many of the issues that made using TensorFlow 1 painful for research, was not enough to reverse this trend. We see a near-monotonic decline in the popularity of TensorFlow, even after the release of TensorFlow 2.

Model Availability - Final Words

It is obvious from the above data that PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape. While TensorFlow 2 made utilizing TensorFlow for research a lot easier, PyTorch has given researchers no reason to go back and give TensorFlow another try. Furthermore, backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2 only exacerbate this issue.

For now, PyTorch is the clear winner in the area of research simply for the reason that it has been widely adopted by the community, and most publications/available models use PyTorch.

There are a couple of notable exceptions / notes:

Google Brain: Google Brain makes heavy use of JAX and makes use of Flax - Google's neural network library for JAX.
DeepMind: DeepMind standardized the use of TensorFlow in 2016, although they announced in 2020 that they were using JAX to accelerate their research. In this announcement they also give an overview of their JAX ecosystem, most notably Haiku, their JAX-based neural network library.

DeepMind created Sonnet, which is a high-level API for TensorFlow that is tailored towards research and sometimes called “the research version of Keras”, that may be useful to those considering using TensorFlow for research. Note that its development has slowed down. Further, DeepMind’s Acme framework may be essential to Reinforcement Learning practitioners.

OpenAI: On the other hand, OpenAI standardized the usage of PyTorch internally in 2020; but, once again for those in Reinforcement Learning, their older baselines repository is implemented in TensorFlow. Baselines provides high-quality implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, so TensorFlow may be the best choice for Reinforcement Learning practitioners.
JAX: Google has another project called JAX that is growing in popularity in the research community. There is, in some sense, a lot less overhead in JAX compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow; but it’s underlying philosophy is different than both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and for this reason migrating to JAX may not be a good option for most. There are a growing number of models/papers that utilize JAX, and it is being developed at a very rapid pace. While last year the future of JAX was less clear, it is now apparent that JAX is here to stay.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Deployment

While employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for cutting-edge results is the holy grail of Deep Learning applications from an inference perspective, this ideal is not always practical or even possible to achieve in an industry setting. Access to SOTA models is pointless if there is a laborious, error-prone process of making their intelligence actionable. Therefore, beyond considering which framework affords you access to the shiniest models, it is important to consider the end-to-end Deep Learning process in each framework.

TensorFlow has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications since its inception, and for good reason. TensorFlow has a litany of associated tools that make the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.

PyTorch used to be extremely lackluster from a deployment perspective, but it has worked on closing this gap in recent years. The introduction of TorchServe last year and PyTorch Live just a couple of weeks ago has afforded much-needed native deployment tools, but has PyTorch closed the deployment gap enough to make its use worthwhile in an industry setting? Let’s take a look.

TensorFlow

TensorFlow offers scalable production with static graphs which are optimized for inference performance. When deploying a model with TensorFlow, you use either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite depending on the application.

TensorFlow Serving

TensorFlow Serving is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on servers, be them in-house or on the cloud, and is used within the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) end-to-end Machine Learning platform. Serving makes it easy to serialize models into well-defined directories with model tags, and select which model is used to make inference requests while keeping server architecture and APIs static.

Serving allows you to easily deploy models on specialized gRPC servers, which run Google’s open-source framework for high-performance RPC. gRPC was designed with the intent on connecting a diverse ecosystem of microservices, so these servers are well suited for model deployment. Serving as a whole is tightly integrated with Google Cloud via Vertex AI and integrates with Kubernetes and Docker.

TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on mobile or IoT/embedded devices. TFLite compresses and optimizes models for these devices, and more widely addresses 5 constraints for on-device Artificial Intelligence - latency, connectivity, privacy, size, and power consumption. The same pipeline is used to simultaneously export both standard Keras-based SavedModels (used with Serving) and TFLite models, so model quality can be compared.

TFLite can be used for both Android and iOS, as well as microcontrollers (ARM with Bazel or CMake) and embedded Linux (e.g. a Coral device). TensorFlow's APIs for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Swift (archived as of this year), give developers a wide array of language options.

PyTorch

PyTorch has invested in making deployment easier, previously being notoriously lackluster in this arena. Previously, PyTorch users would need to use something like Flask or Django to build a REST API on top of the model, but now they have native deployment options in the form of TorchServe and PyTorch Live.

TorchServe

TorchServe is an open-source deployment framework resulting from a collaboration between AWS and Facebook (now Meta) and was released in 2020. It has features like endpoint specification, model archiving, and observing metrics; but is still older than the TensorFlow alternative. Both REST and gRPC APIs are supported with TorchServe.

PyTorch Live

PyTorch first released PyTorch Mobile in 2019, which was designed to create an end-to-end workflow for the deployment of optimized machine learning models for Android, iOS, and Linux.

PyTorch Live was released in late 2022 to build upon Mobile. It uses JavaScript and React Native to create cross-platform iOS and Android AI-powered apps with associated UIs. The on-device inference is still performed by PyTorch Mobile. Live comes with example projects to bootstrap from, and has plans to support audio and video input in the future

Deployment - Final Words

Currently, TensorFlow still wins on the deployment front. Serving and TFLite are more robust than the PyTorch competitors, and the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices is a must-have for many industries. In contrast, PyTorch Live focuses on mobile only, and TorchServe is still in its infancy. The playing field is more even for applications where models run in the cloud instead of on edge devices. It will be interesting to see how the deployment arena changes in the coming years, but for now Round 2 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to TensorFlow.

A final note on the issues of model availability and deployment: For those who want to use the TensorFlow deployment infrastructure but want access to models that are only available in PyTorch, consider using ONNX to port the models from PyTorch to TensorFlow

#
PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Ecosystems

The final important consideration that separates PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2023 is the ecosystems in which they are situated. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are capable frameworks from a modeling perspective, and their technical differences at this point are less important than the ecosystems surrounding them, which provide tools for easy deployment, management, distributed training, etc. Let’s take a look at each framework’s ecosystem now.

PyTorch
Hub

Beyond platforms like HuggingFace, there is also the official PyTorch Hub - a research-oriented platform for sharing repositories with pre-trained models. Hub has a wide range of models, including those for Audio, Vision, and NLP. It also has generative models, including a GAN for generating high-quality images of celebrity faces.

If you want train PyTorch models on Google's Cloud TPUs, then PyTorch-XLA is the tool for you. PyTorch-XLA is a Python package that connects the two with the XLA compiler. You can check out PyTorch-XLA's GitHub repo here.

TorchVision

TorchVision is PyTorch's official Computer Vision library. It includes everything you need for your Computer Vision projects, including model architectures and popular datasets. For more vision models, you can check out TIMM (pyTorch IMage Models). You can check out the TorchVision GitHub repo here.

TorchText

If your area of expertise is Natural Language Processing rather than Computer Vision, then you might want to check out TorchText. It contains datasets frequently seen in the NLP domain, as well as data processing utilities to operate on these and other datasets. You might want to check out fairseq too, so you can perform tasks like translation and summarization on your text. You can check out the TorchText GitHub repo here.

TorchAudio

Perhaps before you can process text, you need to extract it from an audio file with ASR. In this case, check out TorchAudio - PyTorch's official audio library. TorchAudio includes popular audio models like DeepSpeech and Wav2Vec, and provides walkthroughs and pipelines for ASR and other tasks. You can check TorchAudio's GitHub repo here.

SpeechBrain

If TorchAudio isn't quite what you're looking for, then you might want to check out SpeechBrain - an open-source speech toolkit for PyTorch. SpeechBrain supports ASR, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, and more! If you don’t want to build any models and instead want a plug-and-play tool with features like Auto Chapters, Sentiment Analysis, Entity Detection, and more, check out AssemblyAI’s own Speech-to-Text API.

ESPnet

ESPnet is a toolkit for end-to-end speech processing which uses PyTorch in conjunction with Kaldi's style of data processing. With ESPnet, you can implement end-to-end speech recognition, translation, diarization, and more!

Ecosystem Tools

Check out PyTorch’s Tools page for other libraries that may be useful, such as those tailored to Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. This includes fast.ai - a popular library for producing neural networks using modern best practices.

TorchElastic

TorchElastic was released in 2020 and is the result of collaboration between AWS and Facebook. It is a tool for distributed training which manages worker processes and coordinates restart behaviors so that you can train models on a cluster of compute nodes which can change dynamically without affecting training. Therefore, TorchElastic prevents catastrophic failures from issues such as server maintenance events or network issues so you do not lose training progress. TorchElastic features integration with Kubernetes and has been incorporated into PyTorch 1.9+.

TorchX

TorchX is an SDK for the quick building and deployment of Machine Learning applications. TorchX includes the Training Session Manager API to launch distributed PyTorch applications onto supported schedulers. It is responsible for launching the distributed job while natively supporting jobs that are locally managed by TorchElastic.

Lightning

PyTorch Lightning is sometimes called the Keras of PyTorch. While this comparison is slightly misleading, Lightning is a useful tool for simplifying the model engineering and training processes in PyTorch, and it has matured significantly since its initial release in 2019. Lightning approaches the modeling process in an object-oriented way, defining reusable and shareable components that can be utilized across projects. For more information on Lightning and a comparison of how its workflow compares to vanilla PyTorch, you can check out this tutorial.

TensorFlow
Hub

TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained Machine Learning models ready for fine-tuning, allowing you to use a model like BERT with just a few lines of code. Hub contains TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js models for different use cases, with models available for image, video, audio, and text problem domains. Get started with a tutorial here, or see a list of models here.

Model Garden

If ready-to-use pre-trained models aren’t going to work for your application, then TensorFlow’s Model Garden is a repository that makes the source code for SOTA models available. It is useful if you want to go under-the-hood to understand how models work, or modify them for your own needs - something that is not possible with serialized pre-trained models beyond transfer learning and fine tuning.

Model Garden contains directories for official models maintained by Google, research models maintained by researchers, and curated community models maintained by the community. TensorFlow’s long term goal is to provide pre-trained versions of models from Model Garden on Hub, and for pretrained models on Hub to have available source code in Model Garden.

Extended (TFX)

TensorFlow Extended is TensorFlow's end-to-end platform for model deployment. You can load, validate, analyze, and transform data; train and evaluate models; deploy models using Serving or Lite; and then track artifacts and their dependencies. TFX can be used with Jupyter or Colab, and can use Apache Airflow/Beam or Kubernetes for orchestration. TFX is tightly integrated with Google Cloud and can be used with Vertex AI Pipelines.

Vertex AI

Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s unified Machine Learning platform. It was released this year and seeks to unify services on GCP, AI Platform, and AutoML into one platform. Vertex AI can help you automate, monitor, and govern Machine Learning systems by orchestrating workflows in a serverless manner. Vertex AI can also store artifacts of a workflow, allowing you to keep track of dependencies and a model’s training data, hyperparameters, and source code.

MediaPipe

MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal, cross-platform applied Machine Learning pipelines which can be used for face detection, multi-hand tracking, object detection, and more. The project is open-source and has bindings in several languages including Python, C++, and JavaScript. More information on getting started with MediaPipe and its ready-to-use solutions can be found here.

Coral

While there are a variety of SaaS companies that rely on cloud-based AI, there is a growing need for local AI in many industries. Google Coral was created to address this need, and is a complete toolkit to build products with local AI. Coral was released in 2020 and addresses the difficulties of implementing on-board AI mentioned in the TFLite portion of the Deployment section, including privacy and efficiency.

Coral offers an array of hardware products for prototyping, production, and sensing, some of which are essentially more powerful Raspberry Pis created specifically for AI applications. Their products utilize their Edge TPUs for high performance inference on low-power devices. Coral also offers pre-compiled models for image segmentation, pose estimation, speech recognition, and more to provide scaffolding for developers looking to create their own local AI systems. The essential steps to create a model can be seen in the flowchart below.

Image source
TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for Machine Learning that allows you to train and deploy models both in the browser and server-side with Node.js. They provide documentation with examples and information on how to import Python models, pre-trained models ready for out-of-the-box use, and live demos with associated code.

Cloud

TensorFlow Cloud is a library that allows you to connect your local environment to Google Cloud. The provided APIs are designed to bridge the gap from model building and debugging on your local machine to distributed training and hyperparameter tuning on Google Cloud, without the need to use Cloud Console.

Colab

Google Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment, very similar to Jupyter. It is easy to connect Colab to Google Cloud for GPU or TPU training. Note that PyTorch can also be used with Colab.

Playground

Playground is a small but polished educational tool for understanding the basics of neural networks. It offers a simple dense network visualized inside a clean UI. You can change the number of layers in the network and their sizes to see in real time how features are learned. You can also see how changing hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization strength affects the learning process on different datasets. Playground allows you to play the learning process in real time to see in a highly visual way how inputs are transformed during the training process. Playground even comes with an open-source small neural network library on which it was built so you can understand the nuts and bolts of the network.

Datasets

Google Research’s Datasets is a dataset resource on which Google periodically releases datasets. Google also has a Dataset Search for access to an even wider dataset database. PyTorch users can of course take advantage of these datasets as well.

Ecosystems - Final Words

This round is easily the closest of the three. Google has invested heavily in ensuring that there is an available product in each relevant area of an end-to-end Deep Learning workflow, although how well-polished these products are varies across this landscape. Even still, the close integration with Google Cloud along with TFX make the end-to-end development process efficient and organized, and the ease of porting models to Google Coral devices hands a landslide victory to TensorFlow for some industries. That having been said, it is clear TensorFlow is a fading framework, and the rapid development of ONNX only exacerbates this process given that the TensorFlow ecosystem can be leveraged by teams who build with PyTorch for many applications. For this reason, unlike last year, PyTorch will win this battle.

Round 3 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.

#
PyTorch 2.0 and JAX
PyTorch 2.0

At the end of 2022, PyTorch 2.0 was announced, and it marks a very substantial shift in the story of Deep Learning frameworks. Just as PyTorch had the benefit of learning from TensorFlow's mistakes, PyTorch 2 has the benefit of learning from PyTorch 1's "mistakes". These "mistakes" are really design decisions that made sense in 2016, but less so in 2023. Deep Learning is much more mature than it was when PyTorch 1 was created - just in the last year we've seen substantial progress in models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT.

The flagship feature of PyTorch 2.0 (if you had to pick) is model compilation, which will allow models to be ahead-of-time compiled for lightning-fast execution. PyTorch 2.0 has made efforts to make distributed training simpler too, which means that the lifecycle for PyTorch Deep Learning projects may be reduced.

PyTorch 2.0's first stable release is slated for early March of 2023

JAX

Google's JAX has quickly been growing in popularity. While not a Deep Learning framework itself, it is a numerical computing library with autograd and easy distributed training. Combined with the fact that it is built on XLA, JAX is clearly a very strong candidate for the future of Deep Learning.

The big caveat is that much of its power stems from the fact that JAX takes a functionally-pure approach that may be foreign to PyTorch and TensorFlow practitioners. That having been said, the Deep Learning infrastructure surrounding JAX matures every month; and if the functionally-pure approach does not prove to make JAX a nonstarter, we expect a rapid adoption in the coming years.

At this point, it is apparent that the battle for the future of Deep Learning will be PyTorch 2.0 vs JAX, and only time will tell who the victor is.

#
Should I Use PyTorch or TensorFlow?

As you probably expect, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate does not have a single correct answer - it is only sensible to say that one framework is superior to another with respect to a specific use-case. To help you decide which framework is best for you, we’ve compiled our recommendations into flow charts below, with each chart tailored to a different area of interest.

What if I’m in Industry?

If you perform Deep Learning engineering in an industry setting, you’re likely using TensorFlow. In this case, you should probably stick with it. TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end TensorFlow Extended platform are invaluable for those who need to productionize models. Easy deployment on a gRPC server along with model monitoring and artifact tracking are critical tools for industry use. You may want to start thinking about migrating to PyTorch in the future, but for now you can stick with your current workflow.

On the other hand, if you're starting a project from scratch, it may be advisable to build with PyTorch and then deploy with TensorFlow's tools. If you want to use one ecosystem and don't want to deal with the hassle of ONNX, then TensorFlow remains a good option.

Bottom line: if you have to choose one framework, choose TensorFlow.

What if I’m a Researcher?

If you’re a researcher, you’re likely using PyTorch and should probably stick with it for now. PyTorch is the de facto research framework, and the announcement of PyTorch 2.0 only makes its future more promising. We certainly encourage you to check out JAX (especially if you train on TPUs) and think about being an early adopter, but most researchers will probably want to stick with PyTorch this year.

There are a couple of notable exceptions to this rule, the most notable being that those in Reinforcement Learning should consider using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has a native Agents library for Reinforcement Learning, and DeepMind’s Acme framework is implemented in TensorFlow. OpenAI’s Baselines model repository is also implemented in TensorFlow, although OpenAI’s Gym can be used with either TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you plan to use TensorFlow for your research, you should also check out DeepMind’s Sonnet for higher-level abstractions. That having been said, Reinforcement Learning is finding its way into more and more Deep Learning research, so a stronger PyTorch ecosystem is likely to develop around it in the coming years.

Whichever framework you choose, you should keep your eye on JAX in 2023, especially as its community grows and more publications begin utilizing it.

Bottom line: if you need to choose one framework, choose PyTorch

What if I’m a Professor?

If you’re a professor, which framework to use for a Deep Learning course depends on the goals of the course. If the focus of your course is to produce industry-ready Deep Learning engineers who can hit the ground running with competency in the entire end-to-end Deep Learning process, not just Deep Learning theory, then you should use TensorFlow. In this case, exposure to the TensorFlow ecosystem and its tools along with end-to-end practice projects will be very instructive and valuable.

If the focus of your course is on Deep Learning theory and understanding the under-the-hood of Deep Learning models, then you should use PyTorch. This is especially true if you are teaching a high-level undergraduate course or an early graduate-level course which intends to prepare students to perform Deep Learning research.

Ideally, students should get exposure to each framework, and dedicating some time to understanding the differences between the frameworks is probably valuable despite the time constraints of a single semester. If the course is part of a larger program in Machine Learning with many classes dedicated to different topics, it may be better to stick with the framework best suited for the course material rather than try to give exposure to both.

What if I’m a Hobbyist?

If you’re a hobbyist who’s interested in Deep Learning, which framework you use will depend on your goals. If you’re implementing a Deep Learning model as part of some larger project, then TensorFlow is likely what you want to use, especially if you are deploying to an IoT/embedded device. While you could use PyTorch for mobile applications given the release of PyTorch Live, TensorFlow + TFLite is still the preferred methodology for now.

If your goal is to learn about Deep Learning for its own sake, then which framework is best in this case depends on your background. In general, PyTorch is probably the better option here, especially if you’re used to working in Python. If you’re a total beginner who’s just getting started learning about Deep Learning, see the next section.

What if I’m a Total Beginner?

If you’re a total beginner who’s interested in Deep Learning and just wants to get started, we recommend using Keras. Using its high-level components, you can easily get started understanding the basics of Deep Learning. Once you are prepared to start understanding more thoroughly the nuts-and-bolts of Deep Learning, you have a couple of options:

If you do not want to install a new framework and are worried about how well your competency will translate to a new API, then you can try “dropping down” from Keras to TensorFlow. Depending on your background, TensorFlow may be confusing, in which case try moving to PyTorch.

If you want a framework that more natively feels like Python, then moving to PyTorch may be your best move. In this case, be aware that you’ll have to install a new framework and potentially rewrite custom scripts. Further, if PyTorch seems a bit cumbersome to you, you can compartmentalize your code and get rid of some boilerplate by using PyTorch Lightning.

If you’re a complete beginner, consider watching some YouTube tutorials in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to decide which framework feels more intuitive to you.

#
Final Words

As you can see, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate is a nuanced one whose landscape is constantly changing, and out-of-date information makes understanding this landscape even more difficult. In 2023, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are very mature frameworks, and their core Deep Learning features overlap significantly. Today, the practical considerations of each framework, like their model availability, time to deploy, and associated ecosystems, supersede their technical differences.

You’re not making a mistake in choosing either framework, for both have good documentation, many learning resources, and active communities.  While PyTorch has become the de facto research framework after its explosive adoption by the research community and TensorFlow remains the legacy industry framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.

Hopefully our recommendations have helped you navigate the complicated PyTorch vs TensorFlow landscape! For more helpful information, check out other content on our blog!

This guide walks through the major pros and cons of PyTorch vs TensorFlow, and how you can pick the right framework.\n\nRyan O\'Connor\n\nSenior Developer Educator\n\nDec 14, 2021\n\nPyTorch and TensorFlow are far and away the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. The debate over which framework is superior is a longstanding point of contentious debate, with each camp having its share of fervent supporters.\n\nBoth PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed so quickly over their relatively short lifetimes that the debate landscape is ever-evolving. Outdated or incomplete information is abundant, and further obfuscates the complex discussion of which framework has the upper hand in a given domain.\n\nWhile TensorFlow has a reputation for being an industry-focused framework and PyTorch has a reputation for being a research-focused framework, we’ll see that these notions stem partially from outdated information. The conversation about which framework reigns supreme is much more nuanced going into 2023 - let’s explore these differences now.\n\n#\nPractical Considerations\n\nPyTorch and TensorFlow alike have unique development stories and complicated design-decision histories. Previously, this has made comparing the two a complicated technical discussion about their current features and speculated future features. Given that both frameworks have matured exponentially since their inceptions, many of these technical differences are vestigial at this point.\n\nLuckily for those of us who don’t want their eyes glazing over, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate currently comes down to three practical considerations:\n\nModel Availability: With the domain of Deep Learning expanding every year and models becoming bigger in turn, training State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models from scratch is simply not feasible anymore. There are fortunately many SOTA models publicly available, and it is important to utilize them where possible.\nDeployment Infrastructure: Training well-performing models is pointless if they can’t be put to use. Lowering time-to-deploy is paramount, especially with the growing popularity of microservice business models; and efficient deployment has the potential to make-or-break many businesses that center on Machine Learning.\nEcosystems: No longer is Deep Learning relegated to specific use cases in highly controlled environments. AI is injecting new power into a litany of industries, so a framework that sits within a larger ecosystem which facilitates development for mobile, local, and server applications is important. Also, the advent of specialized Machine Learning hardware, such as Google’s Edge TPU, means that successful practitioners need to work with a framework that can integrate well with this hardware.\n\nWe’ll explore each of these three practical considerations in turn, and then provide our recommendations for which framework to use in different areas.\n\nLooking for more posts like this?\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter!\n\nSubscribe Now\n#\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow - Model Availability\n\nImplementing a successful Deep Learning model from scratch can be a very tricky task, especially for applications such as NLP where engineering and optimization are difficult. The growing complexity of SOTA models makes training and tuning simply impractical, approaching impossible, tasks for small-scale enterprises. Startups and researchers alike simply do not have the computational resources to utilize and explore such models on their own, so access to pre-trained models for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or out-of-the-box inference is invaluable.\n\nIn the arena of model availability, PyTorch and TensorFlow diverge sharply. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own official model repositories, as we’ll explore below in the Ecosystems section, but practitioners may want to utilize models from other sources. Let’s take a quantitative look at model availability for each framework.\n\nHuggingFace\n\nHuggingFace makes it possible to incorporate trained and tuned SOTA models into your pipelines in just a few lines of code.\n\nWhen we compare HuggingFace model availability for PyTorch vs TensorFlow, the results are staggering. Below we see a chart of the total number of models available on HuggingFace that are either PyTorch or TensorFlow exclusive, or available for both frameworks. As we can see, the number of models available for use exclusively in PyTorch absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Almost 92% of models are PyTorch exclusive, up from 85% last year. In contrast, only about 8% being TensorFlow exclusive, with only about 14% of all models available for TensorFlow (down from 16% last year). Further, over 45 thousand PyTorch exclusive models were added in 2022, whereas only about 4 thousand TensorFlow exclusive models were added.\n\nWe see interesting results if we relegate our purview to only the 30 most popular models on HuggingFace. While all models are available in PyTorch and none are TensorFlow exclusive, like last year, the number of models available for both has increased from 19 to 23, indicating that there may be an effort for TensorFlow coverage on the most popular models.\n\nResearch Papers\n\nFor research practitioners especially, having access to models from recently-published papers is critical. Attempting to recreate new models that you want to explore in a different framework wastes valuable time, so being able to clone a repository and immediately start experimenting means that you can focus on the important work.\n\nGiven that PyTorch is the de facto research framework, we would expect the trend we observed on HuggingFace to continue into the research community as a whole; and our intuition is correct.\n\nWe’ve aggregated data from eight top research journals over the past several years into the below graph, which shows the relative proportion of publications that use PyTorch or TensorFlow. As you can see, the adoption of PyTorch was extremely rapid and, in just a few years, grew from use in just about 7% to use in almost 80% of papers that use either PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\nData source\n\nMuch of the reason for this rapid adoption was due to difficulties with TensorFlow 1 that were exacerbated in the context of research, leading researchers to look to the newer alternative PyTorch. While many of TensorFlow’s issues were addressed with the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, PyTorch’s momentum has been great enough for it to maintain itself as the established research-centric framework, at least from a community perspective.\n\nWe can see the same pattern if we look at the fraction of researchers who migrated frameworks. When we look at publications by authors that were using either PyTorch or TensorFlow in 2018 and 2019, we find that the majority of authors who used TensorFlow in 2018 migrated to PyTorch in 2019 (55%), while the vast majority of authors who used PyTorch in 2018 stayed with PyTorch 2019 (85%). This data is visualized in the Sankey diagram below, where the left side corresponds to 2018 and the right side to 2019. Note that the data represent proportions of users of each framework in 2018, not total numbers.\n\nData source\n\nCareful readers will notice that this data is from before the release of TensorFlow 2, but as we will see in the next section, this fact is irrelevant in the research community.\n\nPapers with Code\n\nLastly, we look at data from Papers with Code - a website whose mission it is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, datasets, etc. We’ve plotted the percentage of papers which utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, or another framework over time, with data aggregated quarterly, from late 2017 to the current quarter. We see the steady growth of papers utilizing PyTorch - out of the 3,319 repositories created this quarter, nearly 70% of them are implemented in PyTorch, with just 4% implemented in TensorFlow (down from 11% last year).\n\nConversely, we see the steady decline in use of TensorFlow. Even the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, which addressed many of the issues that made using TensorFlow 1 painful for research, was not enough to reverse this trend. We see a near-monotonic decline in the popularity of TensorFlow, even after the release of TensorFlow 2.\n\nModel Availability - Final Words\n\nIt is obvious from the above data that PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape. While TensorFlow 2 made utilizing TensorFlow for research a lot easier, PyTorch has given researchers no reason to go back and give TensorFlow another try. Furthermore, backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2 only exacerbate this issue.\n\nFor now, PyTorch is the clear winner in the area of research simply for the reason that it has been widely adopted by the community, and most publications/available models use PyTorch.\n\nThere are a couple of notable exceptions / notes:\n\nGoogle Brain: Google Brain makes heavy use of JAX and makes use of Flax - Google\'s neural network library for JAX.\nDeepMind: DeepMind standardized the use of TensorFlow in 2016, although they announced in 2020 that they were using JAX to accelerate their research. In this announcement they also give an overview of their JAX ecosystem, most notably Haiku, their JAX-based neural network library.\n\nDeepMind created Sonnet, which is a high-level API for TensorFlow that is tailored towards research and sometimes called “the research version of Keras”, that may be useful to those considering using TensorFlow for research. Note that its development has slowed down. Further, DeepMind’s Acme framework may be essential to Reinforcement Learning practitioners.\n\nOpenAI: On the other hand, OpenAI standardized the usage of PyTorch internally in 2020; but, once again for those in Reinforcement Learning, their older baselines repository is implemented in TensorFlow. Baselines provides high-quality implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, so TensorFlow may be the best choice for Reinforcement Learning practitioners.\nJAX: Google has another project called JAX that is growing in popularity in the research community. There is, in some sense, a lot less overhead in JAX compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow; but it’s underlying philosophy is different than both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and for this reason migrating to JAX may not be a good option for most. There are a growing number of models/papers that utilize JAX, and it is being developed at a very rapid pace. While last year the future of JAX was less clear, it is now apparent that JAX is here to stay.\n\nWant to learn more about JAX?\n\nCheck out our introductory guide to learn more about JAX, including recommendations on when to use it.\n\nCheck it out\n\nTensorFlow has a long and arduous, if not impossible, journey ahead if it wants to reestablish itself as the dominant research framework.\n\nRound 1 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.\n\n#\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow - Deployment\n\nWhile employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for cutting-edge results is the holy grail of Deep Learning applications from an inference perspective, this ideal is not always practical or even possible to achieve in an industry setting. Access to SOTA models is pointless if there is a laborious, error-prone process of making their intelligence actionable. Therefore, beyond considering which framework affords you access to the shiniest models, it is important to consider the end-to-end Deep Learning process in each framework.\n\nTensorFlow has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications since its inception, and for good reason. TensorFlow has a litany of associated tools that make the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.\n\nPyTorch used to be extremely lackluster from a deployment perspective, but it has worked on closing this gap in recent years. The introduction of TorchServe last year and PyTorch Live just a couple of weeks ago has afforded much-needed native deployment tools, but has PyTorch closed the deployment gap enough to make its use worthwhile in an industry setting? Let’s take a look.\n\nTensorFlow\n\nTensorFlow offers scalable production with static graphs which are optimized for inference performance. When deploying a model with TensorFlow, you use either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite depending on the application.\n\nTensorFlow Serving\n\nTensorFlow Serving is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on servers, be them in-house or on the cloud, and is used within the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) end-to-end Machine Learning platform. Serving makes it easy to serialize models into well-defined directories with model tags, and select which model is used to make inference requests while keeping server architecture and APIs static.\n\nServing allows you to easily deploy models on specialized gRPC servers, which run Google’s open-source framework for high-performance RPC. gRPC was designed with the intent on connecting a diverse ecosystem of microservices, so these servers are well suited for model deployment. Serving as a whole is tightly integrated with Google Cloud via Vertex AI and integrates with Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nTensorFlow Lite\n\nTensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on mobile or IoT/embedded devices. TFLite compresses and optimizes models for these devices, and more widely addresses 5 constraints for on-device Artificial Intelligence - latency, connectivity, privacy, size, and power consumption. The same pipeline is used to simultaneously export both standard Keras-based SavedModels (used with Serving) and TFLite models, so model quality can be compared.\n\nTFLite can be used for both Android and iOS, as well as microcontrollers (ARM with Bazel or CMake) and embedded Linux (e.g. a Coral device). TensorFlow\'s APIs for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Swift (archived as of this year), give developers a wide array of language options.\n\nPyTorch\n\nPyTorch has invested in making deployment easier, previously being notoriously lackluster in this arena. Previously, PyTorch users would need to use something like Flask or Django to build a REST API on top of the model, but now they have native deployment options in the form of TorchServe and PyTorch Live.\n\nTorchServe\n\nTorchServe is an open-source deployment framework resulting from a collaboration between AWS and Facebook (now Meta) and was released in 2020. It has features like endpoint specification, model archiving, and observing metrics; but is still older than the TensorFlow alternative. Both REST and gRPC APIs are supported with TorchServe.\n\nPyTorch Live\n\nPyTorch first released PyTorch Mobile in 2019, which was designed to create an end-to-end workflow for the deployment of optimized machine learning models for Android, iOS, and Linux.\n\nPyTorch Live was released in late 2022 to build upon Mobile. It uses JavaScript and React Native to create cross-platform iOS and Android AI-powered apps with associated UIs. The on-device inference is still performed by PyTorch Mobile. Live comes with example projects to bootstrap from, and has plans to support audio and video input in the future\n\nDeployment - Final Words\n\nCurrently, TensorFlow still wins on the deployment front. Serving and TFLite are more robust than the PyTorch competitors, and the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices is a must-have for many industries. In contrast, PyTorch Live focuses on mobile only, and TorchServe is still in its infancy. The playing field is more even for applications where models run in the cloud instead of on edge devices. It will be interesting to see how the deployment arena changes in the coming years, but for now Round 2 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to TensorFlow.\n\nA final note on the issues of model availability and deployment: For those who want to use the TensorFlow deployment infrastructure but want access to models that are only available in PyTorch, consider using ONNX to port the models from PyTorch to TensorFlow\n\n#\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow - Ecosystems\n\nThe final important consideration that separates PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2023 is the ecosystems in which they are situated. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are capable frameworks from a modeling perspective, and their technical differences at this point are less important than the ecosystems surrounding them, which provide tools for easy deployment, management, distributed training, etc. Let’s take a look at each framework’s ecosystem now.\n\nPyTorch\nHub\n\nBeyond platforms like HuggingFace, there is also the official PyTorch Hub - a research-oriented platform for sharing repositories with pre-trained models. Hub has a wide range of models, including those for Audio, Vision, and NLP. It also has generative models, including a GAN for generating high-quality images of celebrity faces.\n\nImage source\nPyTorch-XLA\n\nIf you want train PyTorch models on Google\'s Cloud TPUs, then PyTorch-XLA is the tool for you. PyTorch-XLA is a Python package that connects the two with the XLA compiler. You can check out PyTorch-XLA\'s GitHub repo here.\n\nTorchVision\n\nTorchVision is PyTorch\'s official Computer Vision library. It includes everything you need for your Computer Vision projects, including model architectures and popular datasets. For more vision models, you can check out TIMM (pyTorch IMage Models). You can check out the TorchVision GitHub repo here.\n\nTorchText\n\nIf your area of expertise is Natural Language Processing rather than Computer Vision, then you might want to check out TorchText. It contains datasets frequently seen in the NLP domain, as well as data processing utilities to operate on these and other datasets. You might want to check out fairseq too, so you can perform tasks like translation and summarization on your text. You can check out the TorchText GitHub repo here.\n\nTorchAudio\n\nPerhaps before you can process text, you need to extract it from an audio file with ASR. In this case, check out TorchAudio - PyTorch\'s official audio library. TorchAudio includes popular audio models like DeepSpeech and Wav2Vec, and provides walkthroughs and pipelines for ASR and other tasks. You can check TorchAudio\'s GitHub repo here.\n\nSpeechBrain\n\nIf TorchAudio isn\'t quite what you\'re looking for, then you might want to check out SpeechBrain - an open-source speech toolkit for PyTorch. SpeechBrain supports ASR, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, and more! If you don’t want to build any models and instead want a plug-and-play tool with features like Auto Chapters, Sentiment Analysis, Entity Detection, and more, check out AssemblyAI’s own Speech-to-Text API.\n\nESPnet\n\nESPnet is a toolkit for end-to-end speech processing which uses PyTorch in conjunction with Kaldi\'s style of data processing. With ESPnet, you can implement end-to-end speech recognition, translation, diarization, and more!\n\nAllenNLP\n\nIf you\'re looking for even more NLP tools, you might want to check out AllenNLP, an open-source NLP research library built on PyTorch and backed by the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nEcosystem Tools\n\nCheck out PyTorch’s Tools page for other libraries that may be useful, such as those tailored to Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. This includes fast.ai - a popular library for producing neural networks using modern best practices.\n\nTorchElastic\n\nTorchElastic was released in 2020 and is the result of collaboration between AWS and Facebook. It is a tool for distributed training which manages worker processes and coordinates restart behaviors so that you can train models on a cluster of compute nodes which can change dynamically without affecting training. Therefore, TorchElastic prevents catastrophic failures from issues such as server maintenance events or network issues so you do not lose training progress. TorchElastic features integration with Kubernetes and has been incorporated into PyTorch 1.9+.\n\nTorchX\n\nTorchX is an SDK for the quick building and deployment of Machine Learning applications. TorchX includes the Training Session Manager API to launch distributed PyTorch applications onto supported schedulers. It is responsible for launching the distributed job while natively supporting jobs that are locally managed by TorchElastic.\n\nLightning\n\nPyTorch Lightning is sometimes called the Keras of PyTorch. While this comparison is slightly misleading, Lightning is a useful tool for simplifying the model engineering and training processes in PyTorch, and it has matured significantly since its initial release in 2019. Lightning approaches the modeling process in an object-oriented way, defining reusable and shareable components that can be utilized across projects. For more information on Lightning and a comparison of how its workflow compares to vanilla PyTorch, you can check out this tutorial.\n\nTensorFlow\nHub\n\nTensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained Machine Learning models ready for fine-tuning, allowing you to use a model like BERT with just a few lines of code. Hub contains TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js models for different use cases, with models available for image, video, audio, and text problem domains. Get started with a tutorial here, or see a list of models here.\n\nModel Garden\n\nIf ready-to-use pre-trained models aren’t going to work for your application, then TensorFlow’s Model Garden is a repository that makes the source code for SOTA models available. It is useful if you want to go under-the-hood to understand how models work, or modify them for your own needs - something that is not possible with serialized pre-trained models beyond transfer learning and fine tuning.\n\nModel Garden contains directories for official models maintained by Google, research models maintained by researchers, and curated community models maintained by the community. TensorFlow’s long term goal is to provide pre-trained versions of models from Model Garden on Hub, and for pretrained models on Hub to have available source code in Model Garden.\n\nExtended (TFX)\n\nTensorFlow Extended is TensorFlow\'s end-to-end platform for model deployment. You can load, validate, analyze, and transform data; train and evaluate models; deploy models using Serving or Lite; and then track artifacts and their dependencies. TFX can be used with Jupyter or Colab, and can use Apache Airflow/Beam or Kubernetes for orchestration. TFX is tightly integrated with Google Cloud and can be used with Vertex AI Pipelines.\n\nVertex AI\n\nVertex AI is Google Cloud’s unified Machine Learning platform. It was released this year and seeks to unify services on GCP, AI Platform, and AutoML into one platform. Vertex AI can help you automate, monitor, and govern Machine Learning systems by orchestrating workflows in a serverless manner. Vertex AI can also store artifacts of a workflow, allowing you to keep track of dependencies and a model’s training data, hyperparameters, and source code.\n\nMediaPipe\n\nMediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal, cross-platform applied Machine Learning pipelines which can be used for face detection, multi-hand tracking, object detection, and more. The project is open-source and has bindings in several languages including Python, C++, and JavaScript. More information on getting started with MediaPipe and its ready-to-use solutions can be found here.\n\nCoral\n\nWhile there are a variety of SaaS companies that rely on cloud-based AI, there is a growing need for local AI in many industries. Google Coral was created to address this need, and is a complete toolkit to build products with local AI. Coral was released in 2020 and addresses the difficulties of implementing on-board AI mentioned in the TFLite portion of the Deployment section, including privacy and efficiency.\n\nCoral offers an array of hardware products for prototyping, production, and sensing, some of which are essentially more powerful Raspberry Pis created specifically for AI applications. Their products utilize their Edge TPUs for high performance inference on low-power devices. Coral also offers pre-compiled models for image segmentation, pose estimation, speech recognition, and more to provide scaffolding for developers looking to create their own local AI systems. The essential steps to create a model can be seen in the flowchart below.\n\nImage source\nTensorFlow.js\n\nTensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for Machine Learning that allows you to train and deploy models both in the browser and server-side with Node.js. They provide documentation with examples and information on how to import Python models, pre-trained models ready for out-of-the-box use, and live demos with associated code.\n\nCloud\n\nTensorFlow Cloud is a library that allows you to connect your local environment to Google Cloud. The provided APIs are designed to bridge the gap from model building and debugging on your local machine to distributed training and hyperparameter tuning on Google Cloud, without the need to use Cloud Console.\n\nColab\n\nGoogle Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment, very similar to Jupyter. It is easy to connect Colab to Google Cloud for GPU or TPU training. Note that PyTorch can also be used with Colab.\n\nPlayground\n\nPlayground is a small but polished educational tool for understanding the basics of neural networks. It offers a simple dense network visualized inside a clean UI. You can change the number of layers in the network and their sizes to see in real time how features are learned. You can also see how changing hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization strength affects the learning process on different datasets. Playground allows you to play the learning process in real time to see in a highly visual way how inputs are transformed during the training process. Playground even comes with an open-source small neural network library on which it was built so you can understand the nuts and bolts of the network.\n\nDatasets\n\nGoogle Research’s Datasets is a dataset resource on which Google periodically releases datasets. Google also has a Dataset Search for access to an even wider dataset database. PyTorch users can of course take advantage of these datasets as well.\n\nEcosystems - Final Words\n\nThis round is easily the closest of the three. Google has invested heavily in ensuring that there is an available product in each relevant area of an end-to-end Deep Learning workflow, although how well-polished these products are varies across this landscape. Even still, the close integration with Google Cloud along with TFX make the end-to-end development process efficient and organized, and the ease of porting models to Google Coral devices hands a landslide victory to TensorFlow for some industries. That having been said, it is clear TensorFlow is a fading framework, and the rapid development of ONNX only exacerbates this process given that the TensorFlow ecosystem can be leveraged by teams who build with PyTorch for many applications. For this reason, unlike last year, PyTorch will win this battle.\n\nRound 3 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.\n\n#\nPyTorch 2.0 and JAX\nPyTorch 2.0\n\nAt the end of 2022, PyTorch 2.0 was announced, and it marks a very substantial shift in the story of Deep Learning frameworks. Just as PyTorch had the benefit of learning from TensorFlow\'s mistakes, PyTorch 2 has the benefit of learning from PyTorch 1\'s "mistakes". These "mistakes" are really design decisions that made sense in 2016, but less so in 2023. Deep Learning is much more mature than it was when PyTorch 1 was created - just in the last year we\'ve seen substantial progress in models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT.\n\nThe flagship feature of PyTorch 2.0 (if you had to pick) is model compilation, which will allow models to be ahead-of-time compiled for lightning-fast execution. PyTorch 2.0 has made efforts to make distributed training simpler too, which means that the lifecycle for PyTorch Deep Learning projects may be reduced.\n\nPyTorch 2.0\'s first stable release is slated for early March of 2023\n\nJAX\n\nGoogle\'s JAX has quickly been growing in popularity. While not a Deep Learning framework itself, it is a numerical computing library with autograd and easy distributed training. Combined with the fact that it is built on XLA, JAX is clearly a very strong candidate for the future of Deep Learning.\n\nThe big caveat is that much of its power stems from the fact that JAX takes a functionally-pure approach that may be foreign to PyTorch and TensorFlow practitioners. That having been said, the Deep Learning infrastructure surrounding JAX matures every month; and if the functionally-pure approach does not prove to make JAX a nonstarter, we expect a rapid adoption in the coming years.\n\nAt this point, it is apparent that the battle for the future of Deep Learning will be PyTorch 2.0 vs JAX, and only time will tell who the victor is.\n\n#\nShould I Use PyTorch or TensorFlow?\n\nAs you probably expect, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate does not have a single correct answer - it is only sensible to say that one framework is superior to another with respect to a specific use-case. To help you decide which framework is best for you, we’ve compiled our recommendations into flow charts below, with each chart tailored to a different area of interest.\n\nWhat if I’m in Industry?\n\nIf you perform Deep Learning engineering in an industry setting, you’re likely using TensorFlow. In this case, you should probably stick with it. TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end TensorFlow Extended platform are invaluable for those who need to productionize models. Easy deployment on a gRPC server along with model monitoring and artifact tracking are critical tools for industry use. You may want to start thinking about migrating to PyTorch in the future, but for now you can stick with your current workflow.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\'re starting a project from scratch, it may be advisable to build with PyTorch and then deploy with TensorFlow\'s tools. If you want to use one ecosystem and don\'t want to deal with the hassle of ONNX, then TensorFlow remains a good option.\n\nBottom line: if you have to choose one framework, choose TensorFlow.\n\nWhat if I’m a Researcher?\n\nIf you’re a researcher, you’re likely using PyTorch and should probably stick with it for now. PyTorch is the de facto research framework, and the announcement of PyTorch 2.0 only makes its future more promising. We certainly encourage you to check out JAX (especially if you train on TPUs) and think about being an early adopter, but most researchers will probably want to stick with PyTorch this year.\n\nThere are a couple of notable exceptions to this rule, the most notable being that those in Reinforcement Learning should consider using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has a native Agents library for Reinforcement Learning, and DeepMind’s Acme framework is implemented in TensorFlow. OpenAI’s Baselines model repository is also implemented in TensorFlow, although OpenAI’s Gym can be used with either TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you plan to use TensorFlow for your research, you should also check out DeepMind’s Sonnet for higher-level abstractions. That having been said, Reinforcement Learning is finding its way into more and more Deep Learning research, so a stronger PyTorch ecosystem is likely to develop around it in the coming years.\n\nWhichever framework you choose, you should keep your eye on JAX in 2023, especially as its community grows and more publications begin utilizing it.\n\nBottom line: if you need to choose one framework, choose PyTorch\n\nWhat if I’m a Professor?\n\nIf you’re a professor, which framework to use for a Deep Learning course depends on the goals of the course. If the focus of your course is to produce industry-ready Deep Learning engineers who can hit the ground running with competency in the entire end-to-end Deep Learning process, not just Deep Learning theory, then you should use TensorFlow. In this case, exposure to the TensorFlow ecosystem and its tools along with end-to-end practice projects will be very instructive and valuable.\n\nIf the focus of your course is on Deep Learning theory and understanding the under-the-hood of Deep Learning models, then you should use PyTorch. This is especially true if you are teaching a high-level undergraduate course or an early graduate-level course which intends to prepare students to perform Deep Learning research.\n\nIdeally, students should get exposure to each framework, and dedicating some time to understanding the differences between the frameworks is probably valuable despite the time constraints of a single semester. If the course is part of a larger program in Machine Learning with many classes dedicated to different topics, it may be better to stick with the framework best suited for the course material rather than try to give exposure to both.\n\nWhat if I’m a Hobbyist?\n\nIf you’re a hobbyist who’s interested in Deep Learning, which framework you use will depend on your goals. If you’re implementing a Deep Learning model as part of some larger project, then TensorFlow is likely what you want to use, especially if you are deploying to an IoT/embedded device. While you could use PyTorch for mobile applications given the release of PyTorch Live, TensorFlow + TFLite is still the preferred methodology for now.\n\nIf your goal is to learn about Deep Learning for its own sake, then which framework is best in this case depends on your background. In general, PyTorch is probably the better option here, especially if you’re used to working in Python. If you’re a total beginner who’s just getting started learning about Deep Learning, see the next section.\n\nWhat if I’m a Total Beginner?\n\nIf you’re a total beginner who’s interested in Deep Learning and just wants to get started, we recommend using Keras. Using its high-level components, you can easily get started understanding the basics of Deep Learning. Once you are prepared to start understanding more thoroughly the nuts-and-bolts of Deep Learning, you have a couple of options:\n\nIf you do not want to install a new framework and are worried about how well your competency will translate to a new API, then you can try “dropping down” from Keras to TensorFlow. Depending on your background, TensorFlow may be confusing, in which case try moving to PyTorch.\n\nIf you want a framework that more natively feels like Python, then moving to PyTorch may be your best move. In this case, be aware that you’ll have to install a new framework and potentially rewrite custom scripts. Further, if PyTorch seems a bit cumbersome to you, you can compartmentalize your code and get rid of some boilerplate by using PyTorch Lightning.\n\nIf you’re a complete beginner, consider watching some YouTube tutorials in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to decide which framework feels more intuitive to you.\n\n#\nFinal Words\n\nAs you can see, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate is a nuanced one whose landscape is constantly changing, and out-of-date information makes understanding this landscape even more difficult. In 2023, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are very mature frameworks, and their core Deep Learning features overlap significantly. Today, the practical considerations of each framework, like their model availability, time to deploy, and associated ecosystems, supersede their technical differences.\n\nYou’re not making a mistake in choosing either framework, for both have good documentation, many learning resources, and active communities. \xa0While PyTorch has become the de facto research framework after its explosive adoption by the research community and TensorFlow remains the legacy industry framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.\n\nHopefully our recommendations have helped you navigate the complicated PyTorch vs TensorFlow landscape!

PyTorch vs TensorFlow in 2023

Should you use PyTorch vs TensorFlow in 2023? This guide walks through the major pros and cons of PyTorch vs TensorFlow, and how you can pick the right framework.

Ryan O'Connor

Senior Developer Educator

Dec 14, 2021

PyTorch and TensorFlow are far and away the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. The debate over which framework is superior is a longstanding point of contentious debate, with each camp having its share of fervent supporters.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed so quickly over their relatively short lifetimes that the debate landscape is ever-evolving. Outdated or incomplete information is abundant, and further obfuscates the complex discussion of which framework has the upper hand in a given domain.

While TensorFlow has a reputation for being an industry-focused framework and PyTorch has a reputation for being a research-focused framework, we’ll see that these notions stem partially from outdated information. The conversation about which framework reigns supreme is much more nuanced going into 2023 - let’s explore these differences now.

#
Practical Considerations

PyTorch and TensorFlow alike have unique development stories and complicated design-decision histories. Previously, this has made comparing the two a complicated technical discussion about their current features and speculated future features. Given that both frameworks have matured exponentially since their inceptions, many of these technical differences are vestigial at this point.

Luckily for those of us who don’t want their eyes glazing over, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate currently comes down to three practical considerations:

Model Availability: With the domain of Deep Learning expanding every year and models becoming bigger in turn, training State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models from scratch is simply not feasible anymore. There are fortunately many SOTA models publicly available, and it is important to utilize them where possible.
Deployment Infrastructure: Training well-performing models is pointless if they can’t be put to use. Lowering time-to-deploy is paramount, especially with the growing popularity of microservice business models; and efficient deployment has the potential to make-or-break many businesses that center on Machine Learning.
Ecosystems: No longer is Deep Learning relegated to specific use cases in highly controlled environments. AI is injecting new power into a litany of industries, so a framework that sits within a larger ecosystem which facilitates development for mobile, local, and server applications is important. Also, the advent of specialized Machine Learning hardware, such as Google’s Edge TPU, means that successful practitioners need to work with a framework that can integrate well with this hardware.

We’ll explore each of these three practical considerations in turn, and then provide our recommendations for which framework to use in different areas.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Model Availability

Implementing a successful Deep Learning model from scratch can be a very tricky task, especially for applications such as NLP where engineering and optimization are difficult. The growing complexity of SOTA models makes training and tuning simply impractical, approaching impossible, tasks for small-scale enterprises. Startups and researchers alike simply do not have the computational resources to utilize and explore such models on their own, so access to pre-trained models for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or out-of-the-box inference is invaluable.

In the arena of model availability, PyTorch and TensorFlow diverge sharply. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own official model repositories, as we’ll explore below in the Ecosystems section, but practitioners may want to utilize models from other sources. Let’s take a quantitative look at model availability for each framework.

HuggingFace

HuggingFace makes it possible to incorporate trained and tuned SOTA models into your pipelines in just a few lines of code.

When we compare HuggingFace model availability for PyTorch vs TensorFlow, the results are staggering. Below we see a chart of the total number of models available on HuggingFace that are either PyTorch or TensorFlow exclusive, or available for both frameworks. As we can see, the number of models available for use exclusively in PyTorch absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Almost 92% of models are PyTorch exclusive, up from 85% last year. In contrast, only about 8% being TensorFlow exclusive, with only about 14% of all models available for TensorFlow (down from 16% last year). Further, over 45 thousand PyTorch exclusive models were added in 2022, whereas only about 4 thousand TensorFlow exclusive models were added.

We see interesting results if we relegate our purview to only the 30 most popular models on HuggingFace. While all models are available in PyTorch and none are TensorFlow exclusive, like last year, the number of models available for both has increased from 19 to 23, indicating that there may be an effort for TensorFlow coverage on the most popular models.

Research Papers

For research practitioners especially, having access to models from recently-published papers is critical. Attempting to recreate new models that you want to explore in a different framework wastes valuable time, so being able to clone a repository and immediately start experimenting means that you can focus on the important work.

Given that PyTorch is the de facto research framework, we would expect the trend we observed on HuggingFace to continue into the research community as a whole; and our intuition is correct.

We’ve aggregated data from eight top research journals over the past several years into the below graph, which shows the relative proportion of publications that use PyTorch or TensorFlow. As you can see, the adoption of PyTorch was extremely rapid and, in just a few years, grew from use in just about 7% to use in almost 80% of papers that use either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Data source

Much of the reason for this rapid adoption was due to difficulties with TensorFlow 1 that were exacerbated in the context of research, leading researchers to look to the newer alternative PyTorch. While many of TensorFlow’s issues were addressed with the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, PyTorch’s momentum has been great enough for it to maintain itself as the established research-centric framework, at least from a community perspective.

We can see the same pattern if we look at the fraction of researchers who migrated frameworks. When we look at publications by authors that were using either PyTorch or TensorFlow in 2018 and 2019, we find that the majority of authors who used TensorFlow in 2018 migrated to PyTorch in 2019 (55%), while the vast majority of authors who used PyTorch in 2018 stayed with PyTorch 2019 (85%). This data is visualized in the Sankey diagram below, where the left side corresponds to 2018 and the right side to 2019. Note that the data represent proportions of users of each framework in 2018, not total numbers.

Data source

Careful readers will notice that this data is from before the release of TensorFlow 2, but as we will see in the next section, this fact is irrelevant in the research community.

Papers with Code

Lastly, we look at data from Papers with Code - a website whose mission it is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, datasets, etc. We’ve plotted the percentage of papers which utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, or another framework over time, with data aggregated quarterly, from late 2017 to the current quarter. We see the steady growth of papers utilizing PyTorch - out of the 3,319 repositories created this quarter, nearly 70% of them are implemented in PyTorch, with just 4% implemented in TensorFlow (down from 11% last year).

Conversely, we see the steady decline in use of TensorFlow. Even the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, which addressed many of the issues that made using TensorFlow 1 painful for research, was not enough to reverse this trend. We see a near-monotonic decline in the popularity of TensorFlow, even after the release of TensorFlow 2.

Model Availability - Final Words

It is obvious from the above data that PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape. While TensorFlow 2 made utilizing TensorFlow for research a lot easier, PyTorch has given researchers no reason to go back and give TensorFlow another try. Furthermore, backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2 only exacerbate this issue.

For now, PyTorch is the clear winner in the area of research simply for the reason that it has been widely adopted by the community, and most publications/available models use PyTorch.

There are a couple of notable exceptions / notes:

Google Brain: Google Brain makes heavy use of JAX and makes use of Flax - Google's neural network library for JAX.
DeepMind: DeepMind standardized the use of TensorFlow in 2016, although they announced in 2020 that they were using JAX to accelerate their research. In this announcement they also give an overview of their JAX ecosystem, most notably Haiku, their JAX-based neural network library.

DeepMind created Sonnet, which is a high-level API for TensorFlow that is tailored towards research and sometimes called “the research version of Keras”, that may be useful to those considering using TensorFlow for research. Note that its development has slowed down. Further, DeepMind’s Acme framework may be essential to Reinforcement Learning practitioners.

OpenAI: On the other hand, OpenAI standardized the usage of PyTorch internally in 2020; but, once again for those in Reinforcement Learning, their older baselines repository is implemented in TensorFlow. Baselines provides high-quality implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, so TensorFlow may be the best choice for Reinforcement Learning practitioners.
JAX: Google has another project called JAX that is growing in popularity in the research community. There is, in some sense, a lot less overhead in JAX compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow; but it’s underlying philosophy is different than both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and for this reason migrating to JAX may not be a good option for most. There are a growing number of models/papers that utilize JAX, and it is being developed at a very rapid pace. While last year the future of JAX was less clear, it is now apparent that JAX is here to stay.

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Deployment

While employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for cutting-edge results is the holy grail of Deep Learning applications from an inference perspective, this ideal is not always practical or even possible to achieve in an industry setting. Access to SOTA models is pointless if there is a laborious, error-prone process of making their intelligence actionable. Therefore, beyond considering which framework affords you access to the shiniest models, it is important to consider the end-to-end Deep Learning process in each framework.

TensorFlow has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications since its inception, and for good reason. TensorFlow has a litany of associated tools that make the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.

PyTorch used to be extremely lackluster from a deployment perspective, but it has worked on closing this gap in recent years. The introduction of TorchServe last year and PyTorch Live just a couple of weeks ago has afforded much-needed native deployment tools, but has PyTorch closed the deployment gap enough to make its use worthwhile in an industry setting? Let’s take a look.

TensorFlow

TensorFlow offers scalable production with static graphs which are optimized for inference performance. When deploying a model with TensorFlow, you use either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite depending on the application.

TensorFlow Serving

TensorFlow Serving is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on servers, be them in-house or on the cloud, and is used within the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) end-to-end Machine Learning platform. Serving makes it easy to serialize models into well-defined directories with model tags, and select which model is used to make inference requests while keeping server architecture and APIs static.

Serving allows you to easily deploy models on specialized gRPC servers, which run Google’s open-source framework for high-performance RPC. gRPC was designed with the intent on connecting a diverse ecosystem of microservices, so these servers are well suited for model deployment. Serving as a whole is tightly integrated with Google Cloud via Vertex AI and integrates with Kubernetes and Docker.

TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on mobile or IoT/embedded devices. TFLite compresses and optimizes models for these devices, and more widely addresses 5 constraints for on-device Artificial Intelligence - latency, connectivity, privacy, size, and power consumption. The same pipeline is used to simultaneously export both standard Keras-based SavedModels (used with Serving) and TFLite models, so model quality can be compared.

TFLite can be used for both Android and iOS, as well as microcontrollers (ARM with Bazel or CMake) and embedded Linux (e.g. a Coral device). TensorFlow's APIs for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Swift (archived as of this year), give developers a wide array of language options.

PyTorch

PyTorch has invested in making deployment easier, previously being notoriously lackluster in this arena. Previously, PyTorch users would need to use something like Flask or Django to build a REST API on top of the model, but now they have native deployment options in the form of TorchServe and PyTorch Live.

TorchServe

TorchServe is an open-source deployment framework resulting from a collaboration between AWS and Facebook (now Meta) and was released in 2020. It has features like endpoint specification, model archiving, and observing metrics; but is still older than the TensorFlow alternative. Both REST and gRPC APIs are supported with TorchServe.

PyTorch Live

PyTorch first released PyTorch Mobile in 2019, which was designed to create an end-to-end workflow for the deployment of optimized machine learning models for Android, iOS, and Linux.

PyTorch Live was released in late 2022 to build upon Mobile. It uses JavaScript and React Native to create cross-platform iOS and Android AI-powered apps with associated UIs. The on-device inference is still performed by PyTorch Mobile. Live comes with example projects to bootstrap from, and has plans to support audio and video input in the future

Deployment - Final Words

Currently, TensorFlow still wins on the deployment front. Serving and TFLite are more robust than the PyTorch competitors, and the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices is a must-have for many industries. In contrast, PyTorch Live focuses on mobile only, and TorchServe is still in its infancy. The playing field is more even for applications where models run in the cloud instead of on edge devices. It will be interesting to see how the deployment arena changes in the coming years, but for now Round 2 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to TensorFlow.

A final note on the issues of model availability and deployment: For those who want to use the TensorFlow deployment infrastructure but want access to models that are only available in PyTorch, consider using ONNX to port the models from PyTorch to TensorFlow

PyTorch vs TensorFlow - Ecosystems

The final important consideration that separates PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2023 is the ecosystems in which they are situated. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are capable frameworks from a modeling perspective, and their technical differences at this point are less important than the ecosystems surrounding them, which provide tools for easy deployment, management, distributed training, etc. Let’s take a look at each framework’s ecosystem now.

PyTorch
Hub

Beyond platforms like HuggingFace, there is also the official PyTorch Hub - a research-oriented platform for sharing repositories with pre-trained models. Hub has a wide range of models, including those for Audio, Vision, and NLP. It also has generative models, including a GAN for generating high-quality images of celebrity faces.

Image source
PyTorch-XLA

If you want train PyTorch models on Google's Cloud TPUs, then PyTorch-XLA is the tool for you. PyTorch-XLA is a Python package that connects the two with the XLA compiler. You can check out PyTorch-XLA's GitHub repo here.

TorchVision

TorchVision is PyTorch's official Computer Vision library. It includes everything you need for your Computer Vision projects, including model architectures and popular datasets. For more vision models, you can check out TIMM (pyTorch IMage Models). You can check out the TorchVision GitHub repo here.

TorchText

If your area of expertise is Natural Language Processing rather than Computer Vision, then you might want to check out TorchText. It contains datasets frequently seen in the NLP domain, as well as data processing utilities to operate on these and other datasets. You might want to check out fairseq too, so you can perform tasks like translation and summarization on your text. You can check out the TorchText GitHub repo here.

TorchAudio

Perhaps before you can process text, you need to extract it from an audio file with ASR. In this case, check out TorchAudio - PyTorch's official audio library. TorchAudio includes popular audio models like DeepSpeech and Wav2Vec, and provides walkthroughs and pipelines for ASR and other tasks. You can check TorchAudio's GitHub repo here.

SpeechBrain

If TorchAudio isn't quite what you're looking for, then you might want to check out SpeechBrain - an open-source speech toolkit for PyTorch. SpeechBrain supports ASR, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, and more! If you don’t want to build any models and instead want a plug-and-play tool with features like Auto Chapters, Sentiment Analysis, Entity Detection, and more, check out AssemblyAI’s own Speech-to-Text API.

ESPnet

ESPnet is a toolkit for end-to-end speech processing which uses PyTorch in conjunction with Kaldi's style of data processing. With ESPnet, you can implement end-to-end speech recognition, translation, diarization, and more!

AllenNLP

If you're looking for even more NLP tools, you might want to check out AllenNLP, an open-source NLP research library built on PyTorch and backed by the Allen Institute for AI.

Ecosystem Tools

Check out PyTorch’s Tools page for other libraries that may be useful, such as those tailored to Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. This includes fast.ai - a popular library for producing neural networks using modern best practices.

TorchElastic

TorchElastic was released in 2020 and is the result of collaboration between AWS and Facebook. It is a tool for distributed training which manages worker processes and coordinates restart behaviors so that you can train models on a cluster of compute nodes which can change dynamically without affecting training. Therefore, TorchElastic prevents catastrophic failures from issues such as server maintenance events or network issues so you do not lose training progress. TorchElastic features integration with Kubernetes and has been incorporated into PyTorch 1.9+.

TorchX

TorchX is an SDK for the quick building and deployment of Machine Learning applications. TorchX includes the Training Session Manager API to launch distributed PyTorch applications onto supported schedulers. It is responsible for launching the distributed job while natively supporting jobs that are locally managed by TorchElastic.

Lightning

PyTorch Lightning is sometimes called the Keras of PyTorch. While this comparison is slightly misleading, Lightning is a useful tool for simplifying the model engineering and training processes in PyTorch, and it has matured significantly since its initial release in 2019. Lightning approaches the modeling process in an object-oriented way, defining reusable and shareable components that can be utilized across projects. For more information on Lightning and a comparison of how its workflow compares to vanilla PyTorch, you can check out this tutorial.

TensorFlow
Hub

TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained Machine Learning models ready for fine-tuning, allowing you to use a model like BERT with just a few lines of code. Hub contains TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js models for different use cases, with models available for image, video, audio, and text problem domains. Get started with a tutorial here, or see a list of models here.

Model Garden

If ready-to-use pre-trained models aren’t going to work for your application, then TensorFlow’s Model Garden is a repository that makes the source code for SOTA models available. It is useful if you want to go under-the-hood to understand how models work, or modify them for your own needs - something that is not possible with serialized pre-trained models beyond transfer learning and fine tuning.

Model Garden contains directories for official models maintained by Google, research models maintained by researchers, and curated community models maintained by the community. TensorFlow’s long term goal is to provide pre-trained versions of models from Model Garden on Hub, and for pretrained models on Hub to have available source code in Model Garden.

Extended (TFX)

TensorFlow Extended is TensorFlow's end-to-end platform for model deployment. You can load, validate, analyze, and transform data; train and evaluate models; deploy models using Serving or Lite; and then track artifacts and their dependencies. TFX can be used with Jupyter or Colab, and can use Apache Airflow/Beam or Kubernetes for orchestration. TFX is tightly integrated with Google Cloud and can be used with Vertex AI Pipelines.

Vertex AI

Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s unified Machine Learning platform. It was released this year and seeks to unify services on GCP, AI Platform, and AutoML into one platform. Vertex AI can help you automate, monitor, and govern Machine Learning systems by orchestrating workflows in a serverless manner. Vertex AI can also store artifacts of a workflow, allowing you to keep track of dependencies and a model’s training data, hyperparameters, and source code.

MediaPipe

MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal, cross-platform applied Machine Learning pipelines which can be used for face detection, multi-hand tracking, object detection, and more. The project is open-source and has bindings in several languages including Python, C++, and JavaScript. More information on getting started with MediaPipe and its ready-to-use solutions can be found here.

Coral

While there are a variety of SaaS companies that rely on cloud-based AI, there is a growing need for local AI in many industries. Google Coral was created to address this need, and is a complete toolkit to build products with local AI. Coral was released in 2020 and addresses the difficulties of implementing on-board AI mentioned in the TFLite portion of the Deployment section, including privacy and efficiency.

Coral offers an array of hardware products for prototyping, production, and sensing, some of which are essentially more powerful Raspberry Pis created specifically for AI applications. Their products utilize their Edge TPUs for high performance inference on low-power devices. Coral also offers pre-compiled models for image segmentation, pose estimation, speech recognition, and more to provide scaffolding for developers looking to create their own local AI systems. The essential steps to create a model can be seen in the flowchart below.

Image source
TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for Machine Learning that allows you to train and deploy models both in the browser and server-side with Node.js. They provide documentation with examples and information on how to import Python models, pre-trained models ready for out-of-the-box use, and live demos with associated code.

Cloud

TensorFlow Cloud is a library that allows you to connect your local environment to Google Cloud. The provided APIs are designed to bridge the gap from model building and debugging on your local machine to distributed training and hyperparameter tuning on Google Cloud, without the need to use Cloud Console.

Colab

Google Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment, very similar to Jupyter. It is easy to connect Colab to Google Cloud for GPU or TPU training. Note that PyTorch can also be used with Colab.

Playground

Playground is a small but polished educational tool for understanding the basics of neural networks. It offers a simple dense network visualized inside a clean UI. You can change the number of layers in the network and their sizes to see in real time how features are learned. You can also see how changing hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization strength affects the learning process on different datasets. Playground allows you to play the learning process in real time to see in a highly visual way how inputs are transformed during the training process. Playground even comes with an open-source small neural network library on which it was built so you can understand the nuts and bolts of the network.

Datasets

Google Research’s Datasets is a dataset resource on which Google periodically releases datasets. Google also has a Dataset Search for access to an even wider dataset database. PyTorch users can of course take advantage of these datasets as well.

Ecosystems - Final Words

This round is easily the closest of the three. Google has invested heavily in ensuring that there is an available product in each relevant area of an end-to-end Deep Learning workflow, although how well-polished these products are varies across this landscape. Even still, the close integration with Google Cloud along with TFX make the end-to-end development process efficient and organized, and the ease of porting models to Google Coral devices hands a landslide victory to TensorFlow for some industries. That having been said, it is clear TensorFlow is a fading framework, and the rapid development of ONNX only exacerbates this process given that the TensorFlow ecosystem can be leveraged by teams who build with PyTorch for many applications. For this reason, unlike last year, PyTorch will win this battle.

Round 3 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.

#
PyTorch 2.0 and JAX
PyTorch 2.0

At the end of 2022, PyTorch 2.0 was announced, and it marks a very substantial shift in the story of Deep Learning frameworks. Just as PyTorch had the benefit of learning from TensorFlow's mistakes, PyTorch 2 has the benefit of learning from PyTorch 1's "mistakes". These "mistakes" are really design decisions that made sense in 2016, but less so in 2023. Deep Learning is much more mature than it was when PyTorch 1 was created - just in the last year we've seen substantial progress in models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT.

The flagship feature of PyTorch 2.0 (if you had to pick) is model compilation, which will allow models to be ahead-of-time compiled for lightning-fast execution. PyTorch 2.0 has made efforts to make distributed training simpler too, which means that the lifecycle for PyTorch Deep Learning projects may be reduced.

PyTorch 2.0's first stable release is slated for early March of 2023

JAX

Google's JAX has quickly been growing in popularity. While not a Deep Learning framework itself, it is a numerical computing library with autograd and easy distributed training. Combined with the fact that it is built on XLA, JAX is clearly a very strong candidate for the future of Deep Learning.

The big caveat is that much of its power stems from the fact that JAX takes a functionally-pure approach that may be foreign to PyTorch and TensorFlow practitioners. That having been said, the Deep Learning infrastructure surrounding JAX matures every month; and if the functionally-pure approach does not prove to make JAX a nonstarter, we expect a rapid adoption in the coming years.

At this point, it is apparent that the battle for the future of Deep Learning will be PyTorch 2.0 vs JAX, and only time will tell who the victor is.

#
Should I Use PyTorch or TensorFlow?

As you probably expect, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate does not have a single correct answer - it is only sensible to say that one framework is superior to another with respect to a specific use-case. To help you decide which framework is best for you, we’ve compiled our recommendations into flow charts below, with each chart tailored to a different area of interest.

What if I’m in Industry?

If you perform Deep Learning engineering in an industry setting, you’re likely using TensorFlow. In this case, you should probably stick with it. TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end TensorFlow Extended platform are invaluable for those who need to productionize models. Easy deployment on a gRPC server along with model monitoring and artifact tracking are critical tools for industry use. You may want to start thinking about migrating to PyTorch in the future, but for now you can stick with your current workflow.

On the other hand, if you're starting a project from scratch, it may be advisable to build with PyTorch and then deploy with TensorFlow's tools. If you want to use one ecosystem and don't want to deal with the hassle of ONNX, then TensorFlow remains a good option.

Bottom line: if you have to choose one framework, choose TensorFlow.

What if I’m a Researcher?

If you’re a researcher, you’re likely using PyTorch and should probably stick with it for now. PyTorch is the de facto research framework, and the announcement of PyTorch 2.0 only makes its future more promising. We certainly encourage you to check out JAX (especially if you train on TPUs) and think about being an early adopter, but most researchers will probably want to stick with PyTorch this year.

There are a couple of notable exceptions to this rule, the most notable being that those in Reinforcement Learning should consider using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has a native Agents library for Reinforcement Learning, and DeepMind’s Acme framework is implemented in TensorFlow. OpenAI’s Baselines model repository is also implemented in TensorFlow, although OpenAI’s Gym can be used with either TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you plan to use TensorFlow for your research, you should also check out DeepMind’s Sonnet for higher-level abstractions. That having been said, Reinforcement Learning is finding its way into more and more Deep Learning research, so a stronger PyTorch ecosystem is likely to develop around it in the coming years.

Whichever framework you choose, you should keep your eye on JAX in 2023, especially as its community grows and more publications begin utilizing it.

Bottom line: if you need to choose one framework, choose PyTorch

What if I’m a Professor?

If you’re a professor, which framework to use for a Deep Learning course depends on the goals of the course. If the focus of your course is to produce industry-ready Deep Learning engineers who can hit the ground running with competency in the entire end-to-end Deep Learning process, not just Deep Learning theory, then you should use TensorFlow. In this case, exposure to the TensorFlow ecosystem and its tools along with end-to-end practice projects will be very instructive and valuable.

If the focus of your course is on Deep Learning theory and understanding the under-the-hood of Deep Learning models, then you should use PyTorch. This is especially true if you are teaching a high-level undergraduate course or an early graduate-level course which intends to prepare students to perform Deep Learning research.

Ideally, students should get exposure to each framework, and dedicating some time to understanding the differences between the frameworks is probably valuable despite the time constraints of a single semester. If the course is part of a larger program in Machine Learning with many classes dedicated to different topics, it may be better to stick with the framework best suited for the course material rather than try to give exposure to both.

What if I’m a Hobbyist?

If you’re a hobbyist who’s interested in Deep Learning, which framework you use will depend on your goals. If you’re implementing a Deep Learning model as part of some larger project, then TensorFlow is likely what you want to use, especially if you are deploying to an IoT/embedded device. While you could use PyTorch for mobile applications given the release of PyTorch Live, TensorFlow + TFLite is still the preferred methodology for now.

If your goal is to learn about Deep Learning for its own sake, then which framework is best in this case depends on your background. In general, PyTorch is probably the better option here, especially if you’re used to working in Python. If you’re a total beginner who’s just getting started learning about Deep Learning, see the next section.

What if I’m a Total Beginner?

If you’re a total beginner who’s interested in Deep Learning and just wants to get started, we recommend using Keras. Using its high-level components, you can easily get started understanding the basics of Deep Learning. Once you are prepared to start understanding more thoroughly the nuts-and-bolts of Deep Learning, you have a couple of options:

If you do not want to install a new framework and are worried about how well your competency will translate to a new API, then you can try “dropping down” from Keras to TensorFlow. Depending on your background, TensorFlow may be confusing, in which case try moving to PyTorch.

If you want a framework that more natively feels like Python, then moving to PyTorch may be your best move. In this case, be aware that you’ll have to install a new framework and potentially rewrite custom scripts. Further, if PyTorch seems a bit cumbersome to you, you can compartmentalize your code and get rid of some boilerplate by using PyTorch Lightning.

If you’re a complete beginner, consider watching some YouTube tutorials in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to decide which framework feels more intuitive to you.

#
Final Words

As you can see, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate is a nuanced one whose landscape is constantly changing, and out-of-date information makes understanding this landscape even more difficult. In 2023, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are very mature frameworks, and their core Deep Learning features overlap significantly. Today, the practical considerations of each framework, like their model availability, time to deploy, and associated ecosystems, supersede their technical differences.

You’re not making a mistake in choosing either framework, for both have good documentation, many learning resources, and active communities.  While PyTorch has become the de facto research framework after its explosive adoption by the research community and TensorFlow remains the legacy industry framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.

Hopefully our recommendations have helped you navigate the complicated PyTorch vs TensorFlow landscape! For more helpful information, check out other content on our blog!

This guide walks through the major pros and cons of PyTorch vs TensorFlow, and how you can pick the right framework.\n\nRyan O\'Connor\n\nSenior Developer Educator\n\nDec 14, 2021\n\nPyTorch and TensorFlow are far and away the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. The debate over which framework is superior is a longstanding point of contentious debate, with each camp having its share of fervent supporters.\n\nBoth PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed so quickly over their relatively short lifetimes that the debate landscape is ever-evolving. Outdated or incomplete information is abundant, and further obfuscates the complex discussion of which framework has the upper hand in a given domain.\n\nWhile TensorFlow has a reputation for being an industry-focused framework and PyTorch has a reputation for being a research-focused framework, we’ll see that these notions stem partially from outdated information. The conversation about which framework reigns supreme is much more nuanced going into 2023 - let’s explore these differences now.\n\n#\nPractical Considerations\n\nPyTorch and TensorFlow alike have unique development stories and complicated design-decision histories. Previously, this has made comparing the two a complicated technical discussion about their current features and speculated future features. Given that both frameworks have matured exponentially since their inceptions, many of these technical differences are vestigial at this point.\n\nLuckily for those of us who don’t want their eyes glazing over, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate currently comes down to three practical considerations:\n\nModel Availability: With the domain of Deep Learning expanding every year and models becoming bigger in turn, training State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models from scratch is simply not feasible anymore. There are fortunately many SOTA models publicly available, and it is important to utilize them where possible.\nDeployment Infrastructure: Training well-performing models is pointless if they can’t be put to use. Lowering time-to-deploy is paramount, especially with the growing popularity of microservice business models; and efficient deployment has the potential to make-or-break many businesses that center on Machine Learning.\nEcosystems: No longer is Deep Learning relegated to specific use cases in highly controlled environments. AI is injecting new power into a litany of industries, so a framework that sits within a larger ecosystem which facilitates development for mobile, local, and server applications is important. Also, the advent of specialized Machine Learning hardware, such as Google’s Edge TPU, means that successful practitioners need to work with a framework that can integrate well with this hardware.\n\nWe’ll explore each of these three practical considerations in turn, and then provide our recommendations for which framework to use in different areas.\n\nLooking for more posts like this?\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter!\n\nSubscribe Now\n#\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow - Model Availability\n\nImplementing a successful Deep Learning model from scratch can be a very tricky task, especially for applications such as NLP where engineering and optimization are difficult. The growing complexity of SOTA models makes training and tuning simply impractical, approaching impossible, tasks for small-scale enterprises. Startups and researchers alike simply do not have the computational resources to utilize and explore such models on their own, so access to pre-trained models for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or out-of-the-box inference is invaluable.\n\nIn the arena of model availability, PyTorch and TensorFlow diverge sharply. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own official model repositories, as we’ll explore below in the Ecosystems section, but practitioners may want to utilize models from other sources. Let’s take a quantitative look at model availability for each framework.\n\nHuggingFace\n\nHuggingFace makes it possible to incorporate trained and tuned SOTA models into your pipelines in just a few lines of code.\n\nWhen we compare HuggingFace model availability for PyTorch vs TensorFlow, the results are staggering. Below we see a chart of the total number of models available on HuggingFace that are either PyTorch or TensorFlow exclusive, or available for both frameworks. As we can see, the number of models available for use exclusively in PyTorch absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Almost 92% of models are PyTorch exclusive, up from 85% last year. In contrast, only about 8% being TensorFlow exclusive, with only about 14% of all models available for TensorFlow (down from 16% last year). Further, over 45 thousand PyTorch exclusive models were added in 2022, whereas only about 4 thousand TensorFlow exclusive models were added.\n\nWe see interesting results if we relegate our purview to only the 30 most popular models on HuggingFace. While all models are available in PyTorch and none are TensorFlow exclusive, like last year, the number of models available for both has increased from 19 to 23, indicating that there may be an effort for TensorFlow coverage on the most popular models.\n\nResearch Papers\n\nFor research practitioners especially, having access to models from recently-published papers is critical. Attempting to recreate new models that you want to explore in a different framework wastes valuable time, so being able to clone a repository and immediately start experimenting means that you can focus on the important work.\n\nGiven that PyTorch is the de facto research framework, we would expect the trend we observed on HuggingFace to continue into the research community as a whole; and our intuition is correct.\n\nWe’ve aggregated data from eight top research journals over the past several years into the below graph, which shows the relative proportion of publications that use PyTorch or TensorFlow. As you can see, the adoption of PyTorch was extremely rapid and, in just a few years, grew from use in just about 7% to use in almost 80% of papers that use either PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\nData source\n\nMuch of the reason for this rapid adoption was due to difficulties with TensorFlow 1 that were exacerbated in the context of research, leading researchers to look to the newer alternative PyTorch. While many of TensorFlow’s issues were addressed with the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, PyTorch’s momentum has been great enough for it to maintain itself as the established research-centric framework, at least from a community perspective.\n\nWe can see the same pattern if we look at the fraction of researchers who migrated frameworks. When we look at publications by authors that were using either PyTorch or TensorFlow in 2018 and 2019, we find that the majority of authors who used TensorFlow in 2018 migrated to PyTorch in 2019 (55%), while the vast majority of authors who used PyTorch in 2018 stayed with PyTorch 2019 (85%). This data is visualized in the Sankey diagram below, where the left side corresponds to 2018 and the right side to 2019. Note that the data represent proportions of users of each framework in 2018, not total numbers.\n\nData source\n\nCareful readers will notice that this data is from before the release of TensorFlow 2, but as we will see in the next section, this fact is irrelevant in the research community.\n\nPapers with Code\n\nLastly, we look at data from Papers with Code - a website whose mission it is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, datasets, etc. We’ve plotted the percentage of papers which utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, or another framework over time, with data aggregated quarterly, from late 2017 to the current quarter. We see the steady growth of papers utilizing PyTorch - out of the 3,319 repositories created this quarter, nearly 70% of them are implemented in PyTorch, with just 4% implemented in TensorFlow (down from 11% last year).\n\nConversely, we see the steady decline in use of TensorFlow. Even the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, which addressed many of the issues that made using TensorFlow 1 painful for research, was not enough to reverse this trend. We see a near-monotonic decline in the popularity of TensorFlow, even after the release of TensorFlow 2.\n\nModel Availability - Final Words\n\nIt is obvious from the above data that PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape. While TensorFlow 2 made utilizing TensorFlow for research a lot easier, PyTorch has given researchers no reason to go back and give TensorFlow another try. Furthermore, backward compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2 only exacerbate this issue.\n\nFor now, PyTorch is the clear winner in the area of research simply for the reason that it has been widely adopted by the community, and most publications/available models use PyTorch.\n\nThere are a couple of notable exceptions / notes:\n\nGoogle Brain: Google Brain makes heavy use of JAX and makes use of Flax - Google\'s neural network library for JAX.\nDeepMind: DeepMind standardized the use of TensorFlow in 2016, although they announced in 2020 that they were using JAX to accelerate their research. In this announcement they also give an overview of their JAX ecosystem, most notably Haiku, their JAX-based neural network library.\n\nDeepMind created Sonnet, which is a high-level API for TensorFlow that is tailored towards research and sometimes called “the research version of Keras”, that may be useful to those considering using TensorFlow for research. Note that its development has slowed down. Further, DeepMind’s Acme framework may be essential to Reinforcement Learning practitioners.\n\nOpenAI: On the other hand, OpenAI standardized the usage of PyTorch internally in 2020; but, once again for those in Reinforcement Learning, their older baselines repository is implemented in TensorFlow. Baselines provides high-quality implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, so TensorFlow may be the best choice for Reinforcement Learning practitioners.\nJAX: Google has another project called JAX that is growing in popularity in the research community. There is, in some sense, a lot less overhead in JAX compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow; but it’s underlying philosophy is different than both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and for this reason migrating to JAX may not be a good option for most. There are a growing number of models/papers that utilize JAX, and it is being developed at a very rapid pace. While last year the future of JAX was less clear, it is now apparent that JAX is here to stay.\n\nWant to learn more about JAX?\n\nCheck out our introductory guide to learn more about JAX, including recommendations on when to use it.\n\nCheck it out\n\nTensorFlow has a long and arduous, if not impossible, journey ahead if it wants to reestablish itself as the dominant research framework.\n\nRound 1 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.\n\n#\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow - Deployment\n\nWhile employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for cutting-edge results is the holy grail of Deep Learning applications from an inference perspective, this ideal is not always practical or even possible to achieve in an industry setting. Access to SOTA models is pointless if there is a laborious, error-prone process of making their intelligence actionable. Therefore, beyond considering which framework affords you access to the shiniest models, it is important to consider the end-to-end Deep Learning process in each framework.\n\nTensorFlow has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications since its inception, and for good reason. TensorFlow has a litany of associated tools that make the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.\n\nPyTorch used to be extremely lackluster from a deployment perspective, but it has worked on closing this gap in recent years. The introduction of TorchServe last year and PyTorch Live just a couple of weeks ago has afforded much-needed native deployment tools, but has PyTorch closed the deployment gap enough to make its use worthwhile in an industry setting? Let’s take a look.\n\nTensorFlow\n\nTensorFlow offers scalable production with static graphs which are optimized for inference performance. When deploying a model with TensorFlow, you use either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite depending on the application.\n\nTensorFlow Serving\n\nTensorFlow Serving is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on servers, be them in-house or on the cloud, and is used within the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) end-to-end Machine Learning platform. Serving makes it easy to serialize models into well-defined directories with model tags, and select which model is used to make inference requests while keeping server architecture and APIs static.\n\nServing allows you to easily deploy models on specialized gRPC servers, which run Google’s open-source framework for high-performance RPC. gRPC was designed with the intent on connecting a diverse ecosystem of microservices, so these servers are well suited for model deployment. Serving as a whole is tightly integrated with Google Cloud via Vertex AI and integrates with Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nTensorFlow Lite\n\nTensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on mobile or IoT/embedded devices. TFLite compresses and optimizes models for these devices, and more widely addresses 5 constraints for on-device Artificial Intelligence - latency, connectivity, privacy, size, and power consumption. The same pipeline is used to simultaneously export both standard Keras-based SavedModels (used with Serving) and TFLite models, so model quality can be compared.\n\nTFLite can be used for both Android and iOS, as well as microcontrollers (ARM with Bazel or CMake) and embedded Linux (e.g. a Coral device). TensorFlow\'s APIs for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Swift (archived as of this year), give developers a wide array of language options.\n\nPyTorch\n\nPyTorch has invested in making deployment easier, previously being notoriously lackluster in this arena. Previously, PyTorch users would need to use something like Flask or Django to build a REST API on top of the model, but now they have native deployment options in the form of TorchServe and PyTorch Live.\n\nTorchServe\n\nTorchServe is an open-source deployment framework resulting from a collaboration between AWS and Facebook (now Meta) and was released in 2020. It has features like endpoint specification, model archiving, and observing metrics; but is still older than the TensorFlow alternative. Both REST and gRPC APIs are supported with TorchServe.\n\nPyTorch Live\n\nPyTorch first released PyTorch Mobile in 2019, which was designed to create an end-to-end workflow for the deployment of optimized machine learning models for Android, iOS, and Linux.\n\nPyTorch Live was released in late 2022 to build upon Mobile. It uses JavaScript and React Native to create cross-platform iOS and Android AI-powered apps with associated UIs. The on-device inference is still performed by PyTorch Mobile. Live comes with example projects to bootstrap from, and has plans to support audio and video input in the future\n\nDeployment - Final Words\n\nCurrently, TensorFlow still wins on the deployment front. Serving and TFLite are more robust than the PyTorch competitors, and the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices is a must-have for many industries. In contrast, PyTorch Live focuses on mobile only, and TorchServe is still in its infancy. The playing field is more even for applications where models run in the cloud instead of on edge devices. It will be interesting to see how the deployment arena changes in the coming years, but for now Round 2 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to TensorFlow.\n\nA final note on the issues of model availability and deployment: For those who want to use the TensorFlow deployment infrastructure but want access to models that are only available in PyTorch, consider using ONNX to port the models from PyTorch to TensorFlow\n\n#\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow - Ecosystems\n\nThe final important consideration that separates PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2023 is the ecosystems in which they are situated. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are capable frameworks from a modeling perspective, and their technical differences at this point are less important than the ecosystems surrounding them, which provide tools for easy deployment, management, distributed training, etc. Let’s take a look at each framework’s ecosystem now.\n\nPyTorch\nHub\n\nBeyond platforms like HuggingFace, there is also the official PyTorch Hub - a research-oriented platform for sharing repositories with pre-trained models. Hub has a wide range of models, including those for Audio, Vision, and NLP. It also has generative models, including a GAN for generating high-quality images of celebrity faces.\n\nImage source\nPyTorch-XLA\n\nIf you want train PyTorch models on Google\'s Cloud TPUs, then PyTorch-XLA is the tool for you. PyTorch-XLA is a Python package that connects the two with the XLA compiler. You can check out PyTorch-XLA\'s GitHub repo here.\n\nTorchVision\n\nTorchVision is PyTorch\'s official Computer Vision library. It includes everything you need for your Computer Vision projects, including model architectures and popular datasets. For more vision models, you can check out TIMM (pyTorch IMage Models). You can check out the TorchVision GitHub repo here.\n\nTorchText\n\nIf your area of expertise is Natural Language Processing rather than Computer Vision, then you might want to check out TorchText. It contains datasets frequently seen in the NLP domain, as well as data processing utilities to operate on these and other datasets. You might want to check out fairseq too, so you can perform tasks like translation and summarization on your text. You can check out the TorchText GitHub repo here.\n\nTorchAudio\n\nPerhaps before you can process text, you need to extract it from an audio file with ASR. In this case, check out TorchAudio - PyTorch\'s official audio library. TorchAudio includes popular audio models like DeepSpeech and Wav2Vec, and provides walkthroughs and pipelines for ASR and other tasks. You can check TorchAudio\'s GitHub repo here.\n\nSpeechBrain\n\nIf TorchAudio isn\'t quite what you\'re looking for, then you might want to check out SpeechBrain - an open-source speech toolkit for PyTorch. SpeechBrain supports ASR, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, and more! If you don’t want to build any models and instead want a plug-and-play tool with features like Auto Chapters, Sentiment Analysis, Entity Detection, and more, check out AssemblyAI’s own Speech-to-Text API.\n\nESPnet\n\nESPnet is a toolkit for end-to-end speech processing which uses PyTorch in conjunction with Kaldi\'s style of data processing. With ESPnet, you can implement end-to-end speech recognition, translation, diarization, and more!\n\nAllenNLP\n\nIf you\'re looking for even more NLP tools, you might want to check out AllenNLP, an open-source NLP research library built on PyTorch and backed by the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nEcosystem Tools\n\nCheck out PyTorch’s Tools page for other libraries that may be useful, such as those tailored to Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. This includes fast.ai - a popular library for producing neural networks using modern best practices.\n\nTorchElastic\n\nTorchElastic was released in 2020 and is the result of collaboration between AWS and Facebook. It is a tool for distributed training which manages worker processes and coordinates restart behaviors so that you can train models on a cluster of compute nodes which can change dynamically without affecting training. Therefore, TorchElastic prevents catastrophic failures from issues such as server maintenance events or network issues so you do not lose training progress. TorchElastic features integration with Kubernetes and has been incorporated into PyTorch 1.9+.\n\nTorchX\n\nTorchX is an SDK for the quick building and deployment of Machine Learning applications. TorchX includes the Training Session Manager API to launch distributed PyTorch applications onto supported schedulers. It is responsible for launching the distributed job while natively supporting jobs that are locally managed by TorchElastic.\n\nLightning\n\nPyTorch Lightning is sometimes called the Keras of PyTorch. While this comparison is slightly misleading, Lightning is a useful tool for simplifying the model engineering and training processes in PyTorch, and it has matured significantly since its initial release in 2019. Lightning approaches the modeling process in an object-oriented way, defining reusable and shareable components that can be utilized across projects. For more information on Lightning and a comparison of how its workflow compares to vanilla PyTorch, you can check out this tutorial.\n\nTensorFlow\nHub\n\nTensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained Machine Learning models ready for fine-tuning, allowing you to use a model like BERT with just a few lines of code. Hub contains TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js models for different use cases, with models available for image, video, audio, and text problem domains. Get started with a tutorial here, or see a list of models here.\n\nModel Garden\n\nIf ready-to-use pre-trained models aren’t going to work for your application, then TensorFlow’s Model Garden is a repository that makes the source code for SOTA models available. It is useful if you want to go under-the-hood to understand how models work, or modify them for your own needs - something that is not possible with serialized pre-trained models beyond transfer learning and fine tuning.\n\nModel Garden contains directories for official models maintained by Google, research models maintained by researchers, and curated community models maintained by the community. TensorFlow’s long term goal is to provide pre-trained versions of models from Model Garden on Hub, and for pretrained models on Hub to have available source code in Model Garden.\n\nExtended (TFX)\n\nTensorFlow Extended is TensorFlow\'s end-to-end platform for model deployment. You can load, validate, analyze, and transform data; train and evaluate models; deploy models using Serving or Lite; and then track artifacts and their dependencies. TFX can be used with Jupyter or Colab, and can use Apache Airflow/Beam or Kubernetes for orchestration. TFX is tightly integrated with Google Cloud and can be used with Vertex AI Pipelines.\n\nVertex AI\n\nVertex AI is Google Cloud’s unified Machine Learning platform. It was released this year and seeks to unify services on GCP, AI Platform, and AutoML into one platform. Vertex AI can help you automate, monitor, and govern Machine Learning systems by orchestrating workflows in a serverless manner. Vertex AI can also store artifacts of a workflow, allowing you to keep track of dependencies and a model’s training data, hyperparameters, and source code.\n\nMediaPipe\n\nMediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal, cross-platform applied Machine Learning pipelines which can be used for face detection, multi-hand tracking, object detection, and more. The project is open-source and has bindings in several languages including Python, C++, and JavaScript. More information on getting started with MediaPipe and its ready-to-use solutions can be found here.\n\nCoral\n\nWhile there are a variety of SaaS companies that rely on cloud-based AI, there is a growing need for local AI in many industries. Google Coral was created to address this need, and is a complete toolkit to build products with local AI. Coral was released in 2020 and addresses the difficulties of implementing on-board AI mentioned in the TFLite portion of the Deployment section, including privacy and efficiency.\n\nCoral offers an array of hardware products for prototyping, production, and sensing, some of which are essentially more powerful Raspberry Pis created specifically for AI applications. Their products utilize their Edge TPUs for high performance inference on low-power devices. Coral also offers pre-compiled models for image segmentation, pose estimation, speech recognition, and more to provide scaffolding for developers looking to create their own local AI systems. The essential steps to create a model can be seen in the flowchart below.\n\nImage source\nTensorFlow.js\n\nTensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for Machine Learning that allows you to train and deploy models both in the browser and server-side with Node.js. They provide documentation with examples and information on how to import Python models, pre-trained models ready for out-of-the-box use, and live demos with associated code.\n\nCloud\n\nTensorFlow Cloud is a library that allows you to connect your local environment to Google Cloud. The provided APIs are designed to bridge the gap from model building and debugging on your local machine to distributed training and hyperparameter tuning on Google Cloud, without the need to use Cloud Console.\n\nColab\n\nGoogle Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment, very similar to Jupyter. It is easy to connect Colab to Google Cloud for GPU or TPU training. Note that PyTorch can also be used with Colab.\n\nPlayground\n\nPlayground is a small but polished educational tool for understanding the basics of neural networks. It offers a simple dense network visualized inside a clean UI. You can change the number of layers in the network and their sizes to see in real time how features are learned. You can also see how changing hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization strength affects the learning process on different datasets. Playground allows you to play the learning process in real time to see in a highly visual way how inputs are transformed during the training process. Playground even comes with an open-source small neural network library on which it was built so you can understand the nuts and bolts of the network.\n\nDatasets\n\nGoogle Research’s Datasets is a dataset resource on which Google periodically releases datasets. Google also has a Dataset Search for access to an even wider dataset database. PyTorch users can of course take advantage of these datasets as well.\n\nEcosystems - Final Words\n\nThis round is easily the closest of the three. Google has invested heavily in ensuring that there is an available product in each relevant area of an end-to-end Deep Learning workflow, although how well-polished these products are varies across this landscape. Even still, the close integration with Google Cloud along with TFX make the end-to-end development process efficient and organized, and the ease of porting models to Google Coral devices hands a landslide victory to TensorFlow for some industries. That having been said, it is clear TensorFlow is a fading framework, and the rapid development of ONNX only exacerbates this process given that the TensorFlow ecosystem can be leveraged by teams who build with PyTorch for many applications. For this reason, unlike last year, PyTorch will win this battle.\n\nRound 3 in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to PyTorch.\n\n#\nPyTorch 2.0 and JAX\nPyTorch 2.0\n\nAt the end of 2022, PyTorch 2.0 was announced, and it marks a very substantial shift in the story of Deep Learning frameworks. Just as PyTorch had the benefit of learning from TensorFlow\'s mistakes, PyTorch 2 has the benefit of learning from PyTorch 1\'s "mistakes". These "mistakes" are really design decisions that made sense in 2016, but less so in 2023. Deep Learning is much more mature than it was when PyTorch 1 was created - just in the last year we\'ve seen substantial progress in models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT.\n\nThe flagship feature of PyTorch 2.0 (if you had to pick) is model compilation, which will allow models to be ahead-of-time compiled for lightning-fast execution. PyTorch 2.0 has made efforts to make distributed training simpler too, which means that the lifecycle for PyTorch Deep Learning projects may be reduced.\n\nPyTorch 2.0\'s first stable release is slated for early March of 2023\n\nJAX\n\nGoogle\'s JAX has quickly been growing in popularity. While not a Deep Learning framework itself, it is a numerical computing library with autograd and easy distributed training. Combined with the fact that it is built on XLA, JAX is clearly a very strong candidate for the future of Deep Learning.\n\nThe big caveat is that much of its power stems from the fact that JAX takes a functionally-pure approach that may be foreign to PyTorch and TensorFlow practitioners. That having been said, the Deep Learning infrastructure surrounding JAX matures every month; and if the functionally-pure approach does not prove to make JAX a nonstarter, we expect a rapid adoption in the coming years.\n\nAt this point, it is apparent that the battle for the future of Deep Learning will be PyTorch 2.0 vs JAX, and only time will tell who the victor is.\n\n#\nShould I Use PyTorch or TensorFlow?\n\nAs you probably expect, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate does not have a single correct answer - it is only sensible to say that one framework is superior to another with respect to a specific use-case. To help you decide which framework is best for you, we’ve compiled our recommendations into flow charts below, with each chart tailored to a different area of interest.\n\nWhat if I’m in Industry?\n\nIf you perform Deep Learning engineering in an industry setting, you’re likely using TensorFlow. In this case, you should probably stick with it. TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end TensorFlow Extended platform are invaluable for those who need to productionize models. Easy deployment on a gRPC server along with model monitoring and artifact tracking are critical tools for industry use. You may want to start thinking about migrating to PyTorch in the future, but for now you can stick with your current workflow.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\'re starting a project from scratch, it may be advisable to build with PyTorch and then deploy with TensorFlow\'s tools. If you want to use one ecosystem and don\'t want to deal with the hassle of ONNX, then TensorFlow remains a good option.\n\nBottom line: if you have to choose one framework, choose TensorFlow.\n\nWhat if I’m a Researcher?\n\nIf you’re a researcher, you’re likely using PyTorch and should probably stick with it for now. PyTorch is the de facto research framework, and the announcement of PyTorch 2.0 only makes its future more promising. We certainly encourage you to check out JAX (especially if you train on TPUs) and think about being an early adopter, but most researchers will probably want to stick with PyTorch this year.\n\nThere are a couple of notable exceptions to this rule, the most notable being that those in Reinforcement Learning should consider using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has a native Agents library for Reinforcement Learning, and DeepMind’s Acme framework is implemented in TensorFlow. OpenAI’s Baselines model repository is also implemented in TensorFlow, although OpenAI’s Gym can be used with either TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you plan to use TensorFlow for your research, you should also check out DeepMind’s Sonnet for higher-level abstractions. That having been said, Reinforcement Learning is finding its way into more and more Deep Learning research, so a stronger PyTorch ecosystem is likely to develop around it in the coming years.\n\nWhichever framework you choose, you should keep your eye on JAX in 2023, especially as its community grows and more publications begin utilizing it.\n\nBottom line: if you need to choose one framework, choose PyTorch\n\nWhat if I’m a Professor?\n\nIf you’re a professor, which framework to use for a Deep Learning course depends on the goals of the course. If the focus of your course is to produce industry-ready Deep Learning engineers who can hit the ground running with competency in the entire end-to-end Deep Learning process, not just Deep Learning theory, then you should use TensorFlow. In this case, exposure to the TensorFlow ecosystem and its tools along with end-to-end practice projects will be very instructive and valuable.\n\nIf the focus of your course is on Deep Learning theory and understanding the under-the-hood of Deep Learning models, then you should use PyTorch. This is especially true if you are teaching a high-level undergraduate course or an early graduate-level course which intends to prepare students to perform Deep Learning research.\n\nIdeally, students should get exposure to each framework, and dedicating some time to understanding the differences between the frameworks is probably valuable despite the time constraints of a single semester. If the course is part of a larger program in Machine Learning with many classes dedicated to different topics, it may be better to stick with the framework best suited for the course material rather than try to give exposure to both.\n\nWhat if I’m a Hobbyist?\n\nIf you’re a hobbyist who’s interested in Deep Learning, which framework you use will depend on your goals. If you’re implementing a Deep Learning model as part of some larger project, then TensorFlow is likely what you want to use, especially if you are deploying to an IoT/embedded device. While you could use PyTorch for mobile applications given the release of PyTorch Live, TensorFlow + TFLite is still the preferred methodology for now.\n\nIf your goal is to learn about Deep Learning for its own sake, then which framework is best in this case depends on your background. In general, PyTorch is probably the better option here, especially if you’re used to working in Python. If you’re a total beginner who’s just getting started learning about Deep Learning, see the next section.\n\nWhat if I’m a Total Beginner?\n\nIf you’re a total beginner who’s interested in Deep Learning and just wants to get started, we recommend using Keras. Using its high-level components, you can easily get started understanding the basics of Deep Learning. Once you are prepared to start understanding more thoroughly the nuts-and-bolts of Deep Learning, you have a couple of options:\n\nIf you do not want to install a new framework and are worried about how well your competency will translate to a new API, then you can try “dropping down” from Keras to TensorFlow. Depending on your background, TensorFlow may be confusing, in which case try moving to PyTorch.\n\nIf you want a framework that more natively feels like Python, then moving to PyTorch may be your best move. In this case, be aware that you’ll have to install a new framework and potentially rewrite custom scripts. Further, if PyTorch seems a bit cumbersome to you, you can compartmentalize your code and get rid of some boilerplate by using PyTorch Lightning.\n\nIf you’re a complete beginner, consider watching some YouTube tutorials in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to decide which framework feels more intuitive to you.\n\n#\nFinal Words\n\nAs you can see, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate is a nuanced one whose landscape is constantly changing, and out-of-date information makes understanding this landscape even more difficult. In 2023, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are very mature frameworks, and their core Deep Learning features overlap significantly. Today, the practical considerations of each framework, like their model availability, time to deploy, and associated ecosystems, supersede their technical differences.\n\nYou’re not making a mistake in choosing either framework, for both have good documentation, many learning resources, and active communities. \xa0While PyTorch has become the de facto research framework after its explosive adoption by the research community and TensorFlow remains the legacy industry framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains.\n\nHopefully our recommendations have helped you navigate the complicated PyTorch vs TensorFlow landscape!

Mohan Atreya

When it comes to deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow are two of the most prominent tools in the field. Both have been widely adopted by researchers and developers alike, and while they share many similarities, they also have key differences that make them suitable for different use cases.

In this blog, we’ll explore the main differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow across several dimensions such as ease of use, dynamic vs. static computation, ecosystem, deployment, community, and industry adoption. In a follow-on blog, we plan to describe how Rafay’s customers use both PyTorch and TensorFlow for their AI/ML initiatives.

Background

Before diving into the technical differences, it’s essential to understand the background of both frameworks.

PyTorch was originally developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR) and released in 2016. Since then, it has gained popularity rapidly, especially among researchers. It was designed with a focus on providing flexibility and ease of experimentation.

TensorFlow was created by the Google Brain team and released in 2015. It was one of the first frameworks that allowed developers to create, train, and deploy deep learning models at scale. In general, TensorFlow has had broader adoption because of Google’s backing and its robust production-ready features.

While TensorFlow dominated in earlier years, PyTorch’s momentum has caught up, particularly in the research community. PyTorch is also now governed by the Linux Foundation and benefits due to significant evangelism activities such as the PyTorch Conference.

Comparison

Let us compare and contrast PyTorch and TensorFlow from a number of dimensions that are relevant to users.

Ease of Use

One of the key differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the ease of use, particularly in terms of flexibility and debugging.

PyTorch is known for its intuitive, pythonic style, which appeals to many developers, especially those familiar with Python. With PyTorch, you write standard Python code, which makes it easier to debug using Python’s built-in tools, such as pdb. PyTorch’s execution model is more straightforward for those who prefer an imperative execution approach. This means that operations are computed immediately, allowing for dynamic computation graphs that can be modified on the fly. This makes PyTorch particularly well-suited for researchers who need to experiment and prototype quickly.

TensorFlow, in contrast, initially relied heavily on a static computation graph (aka define-and-run). This approach required the user to first define the computation graph and then run the session to execute it. This was less intuitive for many users and a static graph was harder to debug since you had to inspect the entire graph and didn’t have the flexibility to modify it easily. However, TensorFlow 2.0 addressed these concerns with the introduction of Eager Execution. This works in a manner similar to PyTorch’s dynamic approach. Despite these improvements, TensorFlow still has a steeper learning curve compared to PyTorch, especially for those new to machine learning.

Dynamic vs. Static Computation Graphs

The difference in computation graph execution is another core distinction between the two frameworks.

PyTorch employs dynamic computation graphs, also known as “define-by-run.” This means the graph is created on the go during each iteration of the model. Dynamic graphs offer flexibility, allowing models to change during runtime. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with variable sequence lengths or conditional operations are easier to implement in PyTorch because the graph doesn’t need to be defined before execution.

In TensorFlow, before TensorFlow 2.0, you had to define the entire computation graph beforehand and then execute it. This method, known as “define-and-run,” made certain tasks like debugging and model modification more challenging. TensorFlow 2.0’s Eager Execution mode introduced dynamic computation, closing this gap, but for those who prefer the original static graph mode, TensorFlow still supports it. The static graph allows for optimization techniques that can lead to faster execution and more efficient deployment, especially in production
environments.

Ecosystem and Tools

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow come with a rich set of libraries and tools that enhance the development, training, and deployment of models, but they take slightly different approaches in terms of ecosystems.

TensorFlow has a more extensive ecosystem, with tools designed for various stages of the machine learning lifecycle. Some notable components are

TensorBoard	A visualization tool for tracking and analyzing model performance.
TensorFlow Lite	A lightweight version of TensorFlow optimized for mobile and embedded devices.
TensorFlow Serving	A library for serving machine learning models in production.
TensorFlow Hub	A repository of reusable machine learning models.

PyTorch also has a growing ecosystem, although it historically lagged behind TensorFlow in this regard. PyTorch’s ecosystem includes:

TorchVision	A package for computer vision tasks, offering datasets, models, and transformations.
TorchText	A library for handling text data and NLP tasks.
PyTorch Lightning	A high-level interface for PyTorch that helps organize complex codebases and reduce boilerplate.
ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)	PyTorch can export models to ONNX format, which allows for interoperability between frameworks and deployment in other systems.

TensorFlow’s ecosystem tends to cater more to end-to-end solutions, making it popular for enterprises that want to scale their models from research to production. PyTorch, on the other hand, has been quicker to adopt xperimental features and cater to researchers and academia.

Deployment and Production

In the context of deploying models into production, TensorFlow historically had the upper hand, thanks to its strong industry adoption and tools designed for serving and deployment.

TensorFlow offers TensorFlow Serving, a flexible and high-performance system for serving machine learning models in production environments. Additionally, TensorFlow supports deployment on mobile devices with TensorFlow Lite and on web platforms with TensorFlow.js. These tools make it easier to integrate models into production pipelines and deploy them across different platforms.

PyTorch, while popular among researchers, was initially slower in terms of providing production-level tools. However, with the introduction of TorchServe, a model serving library co-developed with AWS, PyTorch has made significant strides in making deployment easier. PyTorch also supports exporting models to the ONNX format, allowing them to be run in environments optimized for production, such as TensorFlow or other inference engines that support ONNX.

Community and Industry Adoption

Both frameworks have thriving communities, but their appeal varies depending on the audience.

PyTorch has a significant following in the research community. This is partly due to its dynamic computation graph and flexibility, which make it easier for researchers to iterate quickly. Many top AI conferences, such as NeurIPS and CVPR, see more papers written with PyTorch than TensorFlow. The growth of Hugging Face’s Transformers library, which is built on PyTorch, has also contributed to its popularity in NLP tasks.

TensorFlow has broader adoption in industry, especially in large-scale production systems. It’s backed by Google, which lends credibility and support for companies looking for a framework that can handle deployment at scale. TensorFlow’s robust ecosystem makes it a go-to choice for organizations that want a full-stack machine learning framework, from research to production deployment.

Performance and Scalability

In terms of performance, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are highly optimized for speed and scalability.

TensorFlow has built-in support for distributed computing, making it a natural choice for training large-scale models across multiple GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). TensorFlow’s static graph allows for more optimizations at the graph level, potentially leading to faster execution in certain scenarios.

PyTorch has made significant improvements in distributed training with libraries like TorchElastic and Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). While PyTorch’s dynamic graph can lead to slower training times compared to TensorFlow’s static graph, it offers more flexibility, which can be a trade-off depending on the use case.

Conclusion

Ultimately, the choice between PyTorch and TensorFlow depends on your specific needs and the stage of your project.

If you’re focused on research, rapid prototyping, or flexibility, PyTorch may be the better choice due to its intuitive, dynamic nature.
If you’re looking for a full-fledged ecosystem that supports everything from research to production, and especially if you’re working in a large-scale production environment, TensorFlow is likely to be more suitable.

Both frameworks are powerful tools, and as they continue to evolve, they are increasingly incorporating features that were once unique to each other, making the choice less about capabilities and more about preference and the specific requirements of the task at hand.

Both have been widely adopted by researchers and developers alike, and while they share many similarities, they also have key differences that make them suitable for different use cases.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the main differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow across several dimensions such as ease of use, dynamic vs. static computation, ecosystem, deployment, community, and industry adoption. In a follow-on blog, we plan to describe how Rafay’s customers use both PyTorch and TensorFlow for their AI/ML initiatives.\n\nBackground\n\nBefore diving into the technical differences, it’s essential to understand the background of both frameworks.\n\nPyTorch was originally developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR) and released in 2016. Since then, it has gained popularity rapidly, especially among researchers. It was designed with a focus on providing flexibility and ease of experimentation.\n\nTensorFlow was created by the Google Brain team and released in 2015. It was one of the first frameworks that allowed developers to create, train, and deploy deep learning models at scale. In general, TensorFlow has had broader adoption because of Google’s backing and its robust production-ready features.\n\nWhile TensorFlow dominated in earlier years, PyTorch’s momentum has caught up, particularly in the research community. PyTorch is also now governed by the Linux Foundation and benefits due to significant evangelism activities such as the PyTorch Conference.\n\nComparison\n\nLet us compare and contrast PyTorch and TensorFlow from a number of dimensions that are relevant to users.\n\nEase of Use\n\nOne of the key differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the ease of use, particularly in terms of flexibility and debugging.\n\nPyTorch is known for its intuitive, pythonic style, which appeals to many developers, especially those familiar with Python. With PyTorch, you write standard Python code, which makes it easier to debug using Python’s built-in tools, such as pdb. PyTorch’s execution model is more straightforward for those who prefer an imperative execution approach. This means that operations are computed immediately, allowing for dynamic computation graphs that can be modified on the fly. This makes PyTorch particularly well-suited for researchers who need to experiment and prototype quickly.\n\nTensorFlow, in contrast, initially relied heavily on a static computation graph (aka define-and-run). This approach required the user to first define the computation graph and then run the session to execute it. This was less intuitive for many users and a static graph was harder to debug since you had to inspect the entire graph and didn’t have the flexibility to modify it easily. However, TensorFlow 2.0 addressed these concerns with the introduction of Eager Execution. This works in a manner similar to PyTorch’s dynamic approach. Despite these improvements, TensorFlow still has a steeper learning curve compared to PyTorch, especially for those new to machine learning.\n\nDynamic vs. Static Computation Graphs\n\nThe difference in computation graph execution is another core distinction between the two frameworks.\n\nPyTorch employs dynamic computation graphs, also known as “define-by-run.” This means the graph is created on the go during each iteration of the model. Dynamic graphs offer flexibility, allowing models to change during runtime. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with variable sequence lengths or conditional operations are easier to implement in PyTorch because the graph doesn’t need to be defined before execution.\n\nIn TensorFlow, before TensorFlow 2.0, you had to define the entire computation graph beforehand and then execute it. This method, known as “define-and-run,” made certain tasks like debugging and model modification more challenging. TensorFlow 2.0’s Eager Execution mode introduced dynamic computation, closing this gap, but for those who prefer the original static graph mode, TensorFlow still supports it. The static graph allows for optimization techniques that can lead to faster execution and more efficient deployment, especially in production\nenvironments.\n\nEcosystem and Tools\n\nBoth PyTorch and TensorFlow come with a rich set of libraries and tools that enhance the development, training, and deployment of models, but they take slightly different approaches in terms of ecosystems.\n\nTensorFlow has a more extensive ecosystem, with tools designed for various stages of the machine learning lifecycle. Some notable components are\n\nTensorBoard\tA visualization tool for tracking and analyzing model performance.\nTensorFlow Lite\tA lightweight version of TensorFlow optimized for mobile and embedded devices.\nTensorFlow Serving\tA library for serving machine learning models in production.\nTensorFlow Hub\tA repository of reusable machine learning models.\n\nPyTorch also has a growing ecosystem, although it historically lagged behind TensorFlow in this regard. PyTorch’s ecosystem includes:\n\nTorchVision\tA package for computer vision tasks, offering datasets, models, and transformations.\nTorchText\tA library for handling text data and NLP tasks.\nPyTorch Lightning\tA high-level interface for PyTorch that helps organize complex codebases and reduce boilerplate.\nONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)\tPyTorch can export models to ONNX format, which allows for interoperability between frameworks and deployment in other systems.\n\nTensorFlow’s ecosystem tends to cater more to end-to-end solutions, making it popular for enterprises that want to scale their models from research to production. PyTorch, on the other hand, has been quicker to adopt xperimental features and cater to researchers and academia.\n\nDeployment and Production\n\nIn the context of deploying models into production, TensorFlow historically had the upper hand, thanks to its strong industry adoption and tools designed for serving and deployment.\n\nTensorFlow offers TensorFlow Serving, a flexible and high-performance system for serving machine learning models in production environments. Additionally, TensorFlow supports deployment on mobile devices with TensorFlow Lite and on web platforms with TensorFlow.js. These tools make it easier to integrate models into production pipelines and deploy them across different platforms.\n\nPyTorch, while popular among researchers, was initially slower in terms of providing production-level tools. However, with the introduction of TorchServe, a model serving library co-developed with AWS, PyTorch has made significant strides in making deployment easier. PyTorch also supports exporting models to the ONNX format, allowing them to be run in environments optimized for production, such as TensorFlow or other inference engines that support ONNX.\n\nCommunity and Industry Adoption\n\nBoth frameworks have thriving communities, but their appeal varies depending on the audience.\n\nPyTorch has a significant following in the research community. This is partly due to its dynamic computation graph and flexibility, which make it easier for researchers to iterate quickly. Many top AI conferences, such as NeurIPS and CVPR, see more papers written with PyTorch than TensorFlow. The growth of Hugging Face’s Transformers library, which is built on PyTorch, has also contributed to its popularity in NLP tasks.\n\nTensorFlow has broader adoption in industry, especially in large-scale production systems. It’s backed by Google, which lends credibility and support for companies looking for a framework that can handle deployment at scale. TensorFlow’s robust ecosystem makes it a go-to choice for organizations that want a full-stack machine learning framework, from research to production deployment.\n\nPerformance and Scalability\n\nIn terms of performance, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are highly optimized for speed and scalability.\n\nTensorFlow has built-in support for distributed computing, making it a natural choice for training large-scale models across multiple GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). TensorFlow’s static graph allows for more optimizations at the graph level, potentially leading to faster execution in certain scenarios.\n\nPyTorch has made significant improvements in distributed training with libraries like TorchElastic and Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). While PyTorch’s dynamic graph can lead to slower training times compared to TensorFlow’s static graph, it offers more flexibility, which can be a trade-off depending on the use case.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, the choice between PyTorch and TensorFlow depends on your specific needs and the stage of your project.\n\nIf you’re focused on research, rapid\xa0prototyping, or flexibility, PyTorch may be the better choice\xa0due to its intuitive, dynamic nature.\nIf you’re looking for a full-fledged ecosystem that supports everything from research to production, and especially if you’re working in a large-scale production environment, TensorFlow is likely to be more suitable.\n\nBoth frameworks are powerful tools, and as they continue to evolve, they are increasingly incorporating features that were once unique to each other, making the choice less about capabilities and more about preference and the specific requirements of the task at hand.\n\nRecent Posts\nGPU PaaS Unleashed: Empowering Platform Teams to Drive Innovation\nOptimizing AI Workloads for Multi-Cloud Environments with Rafay and GPU PaaS\nOperationalizing AI: Solutions to Machine Learning Workflow Automation Challenges\nKubernetes Best Practices Checklist\n\nGet started with K8s using this checklist of best practices\n\nVIEW NOW\nTrusted by leading companies\n\ninfo@rafay.co\n\n(669) 336-4800\n(877) 355-1777 (toll free)\n\n530 Lakeside Dr, Ste 220 Sunnyvale, CA 94085\n\n   \nOpen Source\nProducts\nProducts\nCloud-native Platform\nGPU & AI/ML Platform\nTechnology\nRafay Platform\nEnvironment Manager\nKubernetes Manager\nIntegrations\nUse Cases\nGPU Cloud\nGPU PaaS\nCloud Standardization\nCluster Lifecycle Management – Public Clouds\nCluster Lifecycle Management – Private Data Center\nCloud Cost Optimization\nAccelerate AI & GenAI Adoption\nSelf Service\nAI Workbenches as a Service\nEnvironment as a Service\nLanding Zones as a Service\nNamespace as a Service\nClusters as a Service\nWhy Rafay\nWhat Rafay?\nWhy Choose Rafay Over Rancher\nWhy Choose Rafay Over VMware\nResources\nBlog\nResource Library\nResearch & Tools\nWhite Papers\nCase Studies\nDatasheets\nVideos\nWebinars\nCompany\nAbout\nServices\nSupport\nCustomer/Partner Training\nEvents\nRafay Partners\nNewsroom & Awards\nCareers\nOthers\nDocs & API\nGPU/AI/ML FAQs\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\n©2025 Rafay Systems, Inc. | All Rights Reserved\n'}]

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be state-of-the-art in many cases of supervised learning, but programming an ANN manually can be a challenging task. As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.

With the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.

Using artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.

Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.

The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.

TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.

Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.

TensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.

TensorFlow Advantages
Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.
Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.
Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.
Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).
Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.
Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.
Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.

TensorFlow Disadvantages
Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.
Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.
Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.
GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.
TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
PyTorch Overview

PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.

The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.

PyTorch 2.0

PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.

For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.

Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.

PyTorch Advantages
PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.
Easier to learn.  Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.
Debugging. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).
Dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
Data parallelism. The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores. Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.
Community. PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.
Distributed Training. PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.
PyTorch Disadvantages
Lacks model serving in production. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.
Limited monitoring and visualization interfaces. While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.
Not as extensive as TensorFlow. PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

 

Comparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
1.) Performance Comparison

The following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.

The table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.

2.) Accuracy

The PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.

The validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.

3.) Training Time and Memory Usage

The above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).

While the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.

The memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.

4.) Ease of Use

PyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.

On the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.

Moreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.

 

Differences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary

The answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.

In general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.

PyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.

TensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.

Another major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.

 

Comparison List
Feature	PyTorch	TensorFlow
Ease of Use	More Pythonic syntax and easier to debug	A steeper learning curve requires more boilerplate code

As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.\n\nWith the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.\n\nUsing artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.\n\n\xa0\n\nTrends of paper implementations grouped by framework: Comparison of\xa0 PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n\n\xa0\n\nThis article describes the effectiveness and differences between these two frameworks based on recent research to compare the training time, memory usage, and ease of use of the two frameworks.

It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.\n\nThe TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.\n\nTensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.\n\nKeras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.\n\nTensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.\n\n\xa0\n\nReal-time computer vision using PyTorch in Construction – built with Viso Suite\n\n\xa0\n\nTensorFlow Advantages\nSupport and library management.\xa0TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.\nOpen-sourced.\xa0TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.\nData visualization.\xa0TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.\nKeras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).\nVery scalable.\xa0TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.\nCompatibility.\xa0TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.\nArchitectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.\n\n\xa0\n\nReal-time object detection using YOLOv7 in an application for smart city and pedestrian detection\nTensorFlow\xa0Disadvantages\nBenchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.\nDependency.\xa0Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.\nSymbolic loops.\xa0TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.\nGPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.\nTensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.\nPyTorch Overview\n\nPyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.\n\nThe open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.\n\nPyTorch 2.0\n\nPyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.\n\nFor mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.\n\nMultiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.\n\n\xa0\n\nObject and Person Detection in Restaurants with YOLOv8, built with PyTorch\n\n\xa0\n\nPyTorch\xa0Advantages\nPyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.\nEasier to learn.\xa0 Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.\nDebugging.\xa0PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).\nDynamic computational graphs.\xa0PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.\nData parallelism.\xa0The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores.\xa0Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.\nCommunity.\xa0PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.\nDistributed Training.\xa0PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.\nPyTorch\xa0Disadvantages\nLacks model serving in production.\xa0While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.\nLimited monitoring and visualization interfaces.\xa0While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.\nNot as extensive as TensorFlow.\xa0PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.\n\n\xa0\n\nComparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n1.) Performance Comparison\n\nThe following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.\n\nThe table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.\n\n2.) Accuracy\n\nThe PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.\n\nThe validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.\n\nAccuracy and Training Time of PyTorch vs. TensorFlow – Source: A Comparison of Two Popular Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n\xa0\n\n3.) Training Time and Memory Usage\n\nThe above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).\n\nWhile the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.\n\nThe memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.\n\n4.) Ease of Use\n\nPyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.\n\nOn the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.\n\nMoreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.\n\n\xa0\n\nDifferences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary\n\nThe answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.\n\nIn general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.\n\nPyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.\n\nTensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.\n\nAnother major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.\n\nBoth PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.\n\n\xa0\n\nComparison List\nFeature\tPyTorch\tTensorFlow\nEase of Use\tMore Pythonic syntax and easier to debug\tA steeper learning curve requires more boilerplate code\nDynamic Computation Graph\tEasier to modify the computation graph during runtime\tStatic computation graph requires recompilation for changes\nGPU Support\tMulti-GPU support is easier to set up and use\tMulti-GPU support is more complex and requires more setup, there is a TF API\nCommunity Support\tNewer community compared to TensorFlow, growing very fast\tLarge and active community with extensive resources\nEcosystem\tHas fewer libraries and tools compared to TensorFlow\tHas an extensive library of pre-built models and tools\nDebugging\tEasier to debug due to Pythonic syntax and dynamic computation graph\tDebugging can be more challenging due to the static computation graph\nResearch\tOften used for research due to its flexibility and ease of use\tOften used for production applications due to its speed and scalability\nMath Library\tPyTorch uses TorchScript for tensor manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations\tTensorFlow uses its own math library for both tensor manipulation and numerical computations\nKeras Integration\tPyTorch does not have a native Keras integration\tTensorFlow has a native Keras integration which simplifies model building and training\n\n\xa0\n\nWhat’s Next With TensorFlow vs. Pytorch?\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article and want to learn more about AI, ML, and DL, we recommend reading:\n\nThe Most Popular Deep Learning Software\nIntroduction to Image Recognition\nObject Detection algorithms\nOpenCV – the famous computer vision library\nMost Popular Deep Learning Frameworks\nFace Recognition Technologies\nActive Learning in Computer Vision\nAll-in-one platform to build, deploy, and scale computer vision applications\nShow me more\n\nviso.ai\n\nProduct\n\nOverview\nEvaluation Guide\nFeature Index\nAcademy\nSecurity\nPrivacy\nSolutions\nPricing\n\nFeatures\n\nComputer Vision\nVisual Programming\nCloud Workspace\nAnalytics Dashboard\nDevice Management\nEnd-to-End Suite\n\nIndustries\n\nAgriculture\nHealthcare\nManufacturing\nRetail\nSecurity\nSmart City\nTechnology\nTransportation\n\nResources\n\nBlog\nLearn\nEvaluation\nSupport\nWhitepaper\n\nAbout\n\nCompany\nCareers\nTerms\nContact\n© 2025 viso.ai\nImprint\nPrivacy\nTerms\nFollow us\nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\nWe value your privacy\nWe use cookies to enhance your browsing experience, serve personalized ads or content, and analyze our traffic.

➡️Flexibility and Design Philosophy

PyTorch: PyTorch’s design is centered around flexibility and user-friendliness. Its dynamic computation graph (eager execution) allows developers to change the behavior of their models on the fly and use native Python control flow operations. This dynamism is particularly suited for complex, iterative model architectures where changes are frequently made. 

It’s like molding clay – you can shape and reshape your model as you go.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow, on the other hand, uses a static computation graph, which requires the definition of the entire model architecture upfront before any actual computation occurs. This approach, while less flexible than PyTorch’s, allows for more straightforward optimization of the models, potentially leading to better performance at scale. 

TensorFlow’s philosophy is akin to constructing a building – you need a detailed blueprint before building.

➡️Impact on Practical Model Building:

PyTorch: The flexibility of PyTorch makes it ideal for research and prototyping, where the ability to tweak and adjust models rapidly is crucial. However, this flexibility can sometimes lead to less optimized models than TensorFlow, particularly for deployment in production environments.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow’s structured approach is beneficial for production environments where models must be scalable and highly optimized. However, this can sometimes slow down the experimentation process, making it less ideal for research purposes where rapid prototyping is required.

Bottomline:

PyTorch might be more appealing for beginners, and researchers focused on experimentation and learning. Conversely, TensorFlow could be the more suitable choice for those looking to deploy scalable and optimized models in production.

➡️Speed and Efficiency

Benchmark Test Scenario: Imagine we’re training a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a standard dataset like MNIST. The CNN will have a few convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The performance metrics to focus on are training time and memory usage.

Results (Hypothetical): 

In such a test, you might find that PyTorch and TensorFlow perform similarly in terms of training speed when running on a GPU. However, variations can occur based on the specific version of the framework and the hardware used. For instance, TensorFlow might slightly edge out in GPU utilization efficiency due to its static graph nature, which the underlying engine can more easily optimize.

Resource Usage: TensorFlow might show a bit more efficiency in memory usage compared to PyTorch, especially in larger and more complex models, thanks to its graph optimizations. PyTorch, with its dynamic graph, might consume more memory for the same task.

➡️Scalability

PyTorch: PyTorch is highly scalable and is being increasingly adopted for large-scale applications. Its dynamic nature doesn’t hinder its scalability. With the introduction of features like TorchScript and PyTorch’s ability to support distributed training, it’s capable of handling large-scale deployments. However, the dynamic graph can add overhead in some cases, especially when scaling to very large models or data sizes.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is renowned for its scalability, particularly in production environments. It excels in situations involving large datasets and complex neural network architectures. TensorFlow’s static computation graph can be optimized for different hardware configurations, making it a robust choice for enterprise-level, large-scale machine learning projects. TensorFlow’s support for distributed training and TensorFlow Serving for model deployment are also key factors in its scalability.

Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.

The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.

TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.

Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.

Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.
Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.
Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.
Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).
Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.
Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.
Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.

TensorFlow Disadvantages
Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.
Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.
Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.
GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.
TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
PyTorch Overview

PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.

The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.

PyTorch 2.0

PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.

For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.

Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.

PyTorch Advantages
PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.
Easier to learn.  Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.
Debugging. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).
Dynamic computational graphs. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
Data parallelism. The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores. Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.
Community. PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.
Distributed Training. PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.
PyTorch Disadvantages
Lacks model serving in production. While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.
Limited monitoring and visualization interfaces. While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.
Not as extensive as TensorFlow. PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

 

Comparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow
1.) Performance Comparison

The following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.

The table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.

2.) Accuracy

The PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.

The validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.

3.) Training Time and Memory Usage

The above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).

While the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.

The memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.

4.) Ease of Use

PyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.

On the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.

Moreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.

 

Differences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary

The answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.

In general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.

PyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.

TensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.

Another major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.

As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models.\n\nWith the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models.\n\nUsing artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models.\n\n\xa0\n\nTrends of paper implementations grouped by framework: Comparison of\xa0 PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n\n\xa0\n\nThis article describes the effectiveness and differences between these two frameworks based on recent research to compare the training time, memory usage, and ease of use of the two frameworks. In particular, you will learn:\n\nCharacteristics of PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\nPerformance, Accuracy, Training, and Ease of Use\nMain Differences PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\nComplete Comparison Table\n\n\xa0\n\nA neural network trained for small object detection in a traffic analysis application built with Viso Suite\n\n\xa0\n\nKey Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch\nTensorFlow Overview\n\nTensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced.\n\nThe TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions.\n\nTensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities.\n\nKeras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.\n\nTensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale.\n\n\xa0\n\nReal-time computer vision using PyTorch in Construction – built with Viso Suite\n\n\xa0\n\nTensorFlow Advantages\nSupport and library management.\xa0TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments.\nOpen-sourced.\xa0TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users.\nData visualization.\xa0TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network.\nKeras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.).\nVery scalable.\xa0TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system.\nCompatibility.\xa0TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.\nArchitectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it.\n\n\xa0\n\nReal-time object detection using YOLOv7 in an application for smart city and pedestrian detection\nTensorFlow\xa0Disadvantages\nBenchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks.\nDependency.\xa0Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution.\nSymbolic loops.\xa0TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API.\nGPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning.\nTensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.\nPyTorch Overview\n\nPyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.\n\nThe open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities.\n\nPyTorch 2.0\n\nPyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community.\n\nFor mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools.\n\nMultiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro.\n\n\xa0\n\nObject and Person Detection in Restaurants with YOLOv8, built with PyTorch\n\n\xa0\n\nPyTorch\xa0Advantages\nPyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and is also one of the most popular languages used for building machine learning models and ML research.\nEasier to learn.\xa0 Because its syntax is similar to conventional programming languages like Python, PyTorch is comparatively easier to learn than other deep learning frameworks.\nDebugging.\xa0PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools (for example, Python’s pdb and ipdb tools).\nDynamic computational graphs.\xa0PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This makes optimizing the model much easier and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.\nData parallelism.\xa0The data parallelism feature allows PyTorch to distribute computational work among multiple CPU or GPU cores.\xa0Although this parallelism can be done in other machine-learning tools, it’s much easier in PyTorch.\nCommunity.\xa0PyTorch has a very active community and forums (discuss.pytorch.org). Its documentation (pytorch.org) is very organized and helpful for beginners; it is kept up to date with the PyTorch releases and offers a set of tutorials. PyTorch is very simple to use, which also means that the learning curve for developers is relatively short.\nDistributed Training.\xa0PyTorch offers native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication, accessible from both Python and C++.\nPyTorch\xa0Disadvantages\nLacks model serving in production.\xa0While this will change in the future, other frameworks have been more widely used for real production work (even if PyTorch becomes increasingly popular in the research communities). Hence, the documentation and developer communities are smaller compared to other frameworks.\nLimited monitoring and visualization interfaces.\xa0While TensorFlow also comes with a highly capable visualization tool for building the model graph (TensorBoard), PyTorch doesn’t have anything like this yet. Hence, developers can use one of the many existing Python data visualization tools or connect externally to TensorBoard.\nNot as extensive as TensorFlow.\xa0PyTorch is not an end-to-end machine learning development tool; the development of actual applications requires conversion of the PyTorch code into another framework, such as Caffe2, to deploy applications to servers, workstations, and mobile devices.\n\n\xa0\n\nComparing PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n1.) Performance Comparison\n\nThe following performance benchmark aims to show an overall comparison of the single-machine eager mode performance of PyTorch by comparing it to the popular graph-based deep learning Framework TensorFlow.\n\nThe table shows the training speed for the two models using 32-bit floats. Throughput is measured in images per second for the AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNet models, in tokens per second for the GNMTv2 model, and samples per second for the NCF model. The benchmark shows that the performance of PyTorch is better compared to TensorFlow, which can be attributed to the fact that these tools offload most of the computation to the same version of the cuDNN and cuBLAS libraries.\n\n2.) Accuracy\n\nThe PyTorch vs Tensorflow Accuracy graphs (see below) shows how similar the accuracies of the two frameworks are. For both models, the training accuracy constantly increases as the models start to memorize the information they are being trained on.\n\nThe validation accuracy indicates how well the model is learning through the training process. For both models, the validation accuracy of the models in both frameworks averaged about 78% after 20 epochs. Hence, both frameworks can implement the neural network accurately and are capable of producing the same results given the same model and data set to train on.\n\nAccuracy and Training Time of PyTorch vs. TensorFlow – Source: A Comparison of Two Popular Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n\xa0\n\n3.) Training Time and Memory Usage\n\nThe above figure shows the training times of TensorFlow and PyTorch. It indicates a significantly higher training time for TensorFlow (an average of 11.19 seconds for TensorFlow vs. PyTorch with an average of 7.67 seconds).\n\nWhile the duration of the model training times varies substantially from day to day on Google Colab, the relative durations between PyTorch vs TensorFlow remain consistent.\n\nThe memory usage during the training of TensorFlow (1.7 GB of RAM) was significantly lower than PyTorch’s memory usage (3.5 GB RAM). However, both models had a little variance in memory usage during training and higher memory usage during the initial loading of the data: 4.8 GB for TensorFlow vs. 5 GB for PyTorch.\n\n4.) Ease of Use\n\nPyTorch’s more object-oriented style made implementing the model less time-consuming. Also, the specification of data handling was more straightforward for PyTorch compared to TensorFlow.\n\nOn the other hand, TensorFlow indicates a slightly steeper learning curve due to the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Hence, its low-level approach allows for a more customized approach to forming the neural network, allowing for more specialized features.\n\nMoreover, the very high-level Keras library runs on top of TensorFlow. So as a teaching tool, the very high-level Keras library can be used to teach basic concepts. Then, TensorFlow can be used to further concept understanding by laying out more of the structure.\n\n\xa0\n\nDifferences of Tensorflow vs. PyTorch – Summary\n\nThe answer to the question “What is better, PyTorch vs Tensorflow?” essentially depends on the use case and application.\n\nIn general, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations show equal accuracy. However, the training time of TensorFlow is substantially higher, but the memory usage was lower.\n\nPyTorch allows quicker prototyping than TensorFlow. However, TensorFlow may be a better option if custom features are needed in the neural network.\n\nTensorFlow treats the neural network as a static object. So, if you want to change the behavior of your model, you have to start from scratch. With PyTorch, the neural network can be tweaked on the fly at run-time, making it easier to optimize the model.\n\nAnother major difference lies in how developers go about debugging. Effective debugging with TensorFlow requires a special debugger tool to examine how the network nodes do calculations at each step. PyTorch can be debugged using one of the many widely available Python debugging tools.\n\nBoth PyTorch and TensorFlow provide ways to speed up model development and reduce the amount of boilerplate code. However, the core difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is that PyTorch is more “pythonic” and based on an object-oriented approach. At the same time, TensorFlow provides more options to choose from, resulting in generally higher flexibility. For many developers familiar with Python, this is an important reason why Pytorch is better than TensorFlow.\n\n\xa0\n\nComparison List\nFeature\tPyTorch\tTensorFlow\nEase of Use\tMore Pythonic syntax and easier to debug\tA steeper learning curve requires more boilerplate code\nDynamic Computation Graph\tEasier to modify the computation graph during runtime\tStatic computation graph requires recompilation for changes\nGPU Support\tMulti-GPU support is easier to set up and use\tMulti-GPU support is more complex and requires more setup, there is a TF API\nCommunity Support\tNewer community compared to TensorFlow, growing very fast\tLarge and active community with extensive resources\nEcosystem\tHas fewer libraries and tools compared to TensorFlow\tHas an extensive library of pre-built models and tools\nDebugging\tEasier to debug due to Pythonic syntax and dynamic computation graph\tDebugging can be more challenging due to the static computation graph\nResearch\tOften used for research due to its flexibility and ease of use\tOften used for production applications due to its speed and scalability\nMath Library\tPyTorch uses TorchScript for tensor manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations\tTensorFlow uses its own math library for both tensor manipulation and numerical computations\nKeras Integration\tPyTorch does not have a native Keras integration\tTensorFlow has a native Keras integration which simplifies model building and training\n\n\xa0\n\nWhat’s Next With TensorFlow vs. Pytorch?\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article and want to learn more about AI, ML, and DL, we recommend reading:\n\nThe Most Popular Deep Learning Software\nIntroduction to Image Recognition\nObject Detection algorithms\nOpenCV – the famous computer vision library\nMost Popular Deep Learning Frameworks\nFace Recognition Technologies\nActive Learning in Computer Vision\nAll-in-one platform to build, deploy, and scale computer vision applications\nShow me more\n\nviso.ai\n\nProduct\n\nOverview\nEvaluation Guide\nFeature Index\nAcademy\nSecurity\nPrivacy\nSolutions\nPricing\n\nFeatures\n\nComputer Vision\nVisual Programming\nCloud Workspace\nAnalytics Dashboard\nDevice Management\nEnd-to-End Suite\n\nIndustries\n\nAgriculture\nHealthcare\nManufacturing\nRetail\nSecurity\nSmart City\nTechnology\nTransportation\n\nResources\n\nBlog\nLearn\nEvaluation\nSupport\nWhitepaper\n\nAbout\n\nCompany\nCareers\nTerms\nContact\n© 2025 viso.ai\nImprint\nPrivacy\nTerms\nFollow us\nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\nWe value your privacy\nWe use cookies to enhance your browsing experience, serve personalized ads or content, and analyze our traffic.

Difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow
Last Updated : 22 Oct, 2020

There are various deep learning libraries but the two most famous libraries are PyTorch and Tensorflow. Though both are open source libraries but sometime it becomes difficult to figure out the difference between the two. They are extensively used in commercial code and academic research.  

PyTorch:

It is an open-source library used in machine learning. It was developed by Facebook and was released to the public for the first time in 2016. It is imperative which means it runs immediately and the user can check if it is working or not before writing the full code. We can write a part of code and check it in real time, it is built-in python based implementation to provide compatibility as a deep learning platform. It rapidly gained users because of its user-friendly interface, which made the Tensorflow team acquire its popular features in Tensorflow 2.0.    

TensorFlow:

Just like PyTorch, it is also an open-source library used in machine learning. It was developed by Google and was released in 2015. Its name itself expresses how you can perform and organize tasks on data. Production and research are the main uses of Tensorflow. Neural networks mostly use Tensorflow to develop machine learning applications.

PyTorch V/S TensorFlow 
S.No	Pytorch	TensorFlow
1	It was developed by Facebook   	It was developed by Google
2	It was made using Torch library.	 It was deployed on Theano which is a python library
3	It works on a dynamic graph concept 	It believes on a static graph concept
4	Pytorch has fewer features as compared to Tensorflow.	Its has a higher level functionality and provides broad spectrum of choices to work on.
5	Pytorch uses simple API which saves the entire weight of model. 	It has a major benefit that whole graph could be saved as protocol buffer.  
6	It is comparatively less supportive in deployments.	It is more supportive for embedded and mobile deployments as compared to Pytorch
7	It has a smaller community.	 It has a larger community.
8	It is easy to learn and understand.	 It is comparatively hard to learn
9	It requires user to store everything into the device. 	Default settings are well-defined in Tensorflow.
10	It has a dynamic computational process. 	It requires the use of debugger tool.  
11	Some of its features or libraries are: PYRO, Horizon, CheXNet, etc.	Some of its features or libraries are: Sonnet, Ludwig, Magenta, etc.  
 Conclusion

It cannot be said that one library is good and one is bad, both are very useful frameworks and are used on a large scale. Both are machine learning libraries which are used to do various tasks. Tensorflow is a useful tool with debugging capabilities and visualization, It also saves graph as a protocol buffer. On the other hand Pytorch is still getting momentum and tempting python developers because of it’s friendly usage. In nutshell Tensorflow is used to automate things faster and make artificial intelligence related products whereas developers which are more research oriented prefer using Pytorch.
